<p>The scientific publications of the United States National Museum consist of
two series, the <i>Proceedings</i> and the <i>Bulletins</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Proceedings</i>, the first volume of which was issued in 1878, are intended
primarily as a medium for the publication of original, and usually brief, papers
based on the collections of the National Museum, presenting newly-acquired facts
in zoology, geology, and anthropology, including descriptions of new forms of
animals, and revisions of limited groups. One or two volumes are issued annually
and distributed to libraries and scientific organizations. A limited number of
copies of each paper, in pamphlet form, is distributed to specialists and others
interested in the different subjects as soon as printed. The date of publication is
printed on each paper, and these dates are also recorded in the tables of contents
of the volume.</p>
<p>The <i>Bulletins</i>, the first of which was issued in 1875, consist of a series of separate
publications comprising chiefly monographs of large zoological groups and other
general systematic treatises (occasionally in several volumes), faunal works, reports
of expeditions, and catalogues of type-specimens, special collections, etc. The
majority of the volumes are octavos, but a quarto size has been adopted in a few
instances in which large plates were regarded as indispensable.</p>
<p>Since 1902 a series of octavo volumes containing papers relating to the botanical
collections of the Museum, and known as the <i>Contributions from the National Herbarium</i>,
has been published as bulletins.</p>
<p>The present work forms No. 73 of the <i>Bulletin</i> series.</p>

<p class="tbcenter">By <span class="sc">Frederick W. True</span>,

<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>
<p>The beaked whales belonging to the family Ziphiid&aelig; are, with the exception
of the bottle-nosed whales of the genus <i>Hypero&ouml;don</i>, among the rarest of cetaceans.
Of the three genera <i>Mesoplodon</i>, <i>Ziphius</i>, and <i>Berardius</i>, so far as I have been able
to ascertain from published records, specimens representing about one hundred
individuals are known, and somewhat more than one-half of these belong to the
first-named genus. <i>Berardius</i> is the rarest genus, only about fourteen specimens
having been collected thus far. The U. S. National Museum contains specimens
representing some twenty-five individuals of the three genera, or about one-fourth
of the material at present available. Among these are six specimens of the genus
<i>Berardius</i>, or nearly half of all that have been recorded thus far.</p>
<p>The most important addition to the knowledge of these whales made during
the last quarter century was the discovery of representatives of the three genera
<i>Mesoplodon</i>, <i>Ziphius</i>, and <i>Berardius</i>, at Bering Island, in the North Pacific, by Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger, whereby the known range of the family was very greatly
extended. Two of the forms were described by Doctor Stejneger in 1883, and the
third by myself from a skull which he collected. About one-half of the material
which the Museum possesses consists of that collected by Doctor Stejneger in Bering
Island and that from the same locality presented by Mr. Nicholas Grebnitzki, Russian
governor of the Commander Islands.</p>
<p>About six years ago the National Museum received information and specimens
from correspondents showing that the range of the three genera found at Bering
Island extends to the eastern North Pacific, one genus (<i>Ziphius</i>) having been
observed at Kiska Harbor, Alaska, another (<i>Mesoplodon</i>) at Yaquina Bay, Oregon,
and the third (<i>Berardius</i>) at St. George Island, Pribilof Group, Alaska, and near
Cape Mendocino, California.</p>

whales known to me are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">DESCRIPTIONS OF SKULLS AND SKELETONS OF ZIPHIOID WHALES.</span></h2>
<h3 id="c3">Genus MESOPLODON Gervais.</h3>
<p>Of this genus the National Museum has four specimens; namely, (1) a skull
(Cat. No. 21112, U.S.N.M.) obtained at Bering Island, North Pacific Ocean, in 1883,
by Dr. L. Stejneger, and made the type of the species <i>M. stejnegeri</i> True; (2) a
skull and photographs (Cat. No. 143132, U.S.N.M.) of the same species, from
Yaquina Bay, Oregon, obtained in exchange from Mr. J. G. Crawford in 1904;
(3) a skeleton, cast, and photographs of a young male (Cat. No. 23346, U.S.N.M.),
hitherto supposed to represent <i>M. bidens</i>, caught at Atlantic City, New Jersey, in
1889; and (4) a skeleton of an adult (Cat. No. 49880, U.S.N.M.) from the Chatham
Islands, New Zealand, representing <i>M. grayi</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In addition to this material, I have had the privilege of examining two skulls
belonging to the Museum of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy, and hitherto supposed to represent
<i>M. bidens</i>, and two skeletons belonging to the American Museum of Natural
History. Of these last, one is that of an adult and was purchased by the American
Museum under the name of <i>M. layardi</i>, but was subsequently recognized to be a
new species and was described by Mr. Andrews, under the name of <i>Mesoplodon
bowdoini</i>. The other is that of a young individual, and has been labeled <i>M. grayi</i>.</p>
<p>As already noted by Dr. G. M. Allen,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> only four specimens of <i>Mesoplodon</i> have
been recorded hitherto from the Atlantic coast of the United States. These are:</p>
<p>1. An adult, sex unknown, but probably female, 16 feet long, found at Nantucket,
Massachusetts, in 1867, and recorded by Prof. L. Agassiz.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
The skull of this individual is in the Museum of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy, Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>2. A young male, 12&frac12; feet long, captured at Atlantic City, New Jersey, March
28, 1889. The skeleton (Cat. No. 23346, U.S.N.M.) is in the National Museum.</p>
<p>3. A young female, 12 feet 2 inches long, stranded at Annisquam, Massachusetts,
August, 1898, and recorded by the late Alpheus Hyatt.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
The skeleton is in the museum of the Boston Society of Natural History.</p>
<p>4. An adult female, said by fishermen who measured it to have been 22 feet
long, entangled in pound nets at North Long Branch, New Jersey, July 22, 1905,
and recorded by Dr. Glover M. Allen.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> The cranium of this individual is preserved
in the Museum of Comparative Zo&ouml;logy. The rostrum and mandible, which were
originally obtained, were afterwards destroyed by accident.</p>
<p>I have examined all this material. Writers who have had occasion to mention
these four specimens thus far have referred them tacitly to <i>Mesoplodon bidens</i>
(Sowerby), but, after a careful study of them, I have ascertained that while the
Nantucket specimen belongs to that species, the Atlantic City and Long Branch
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
specimens represent <i>Mesoplodon europ&aelig;us</i> (Gervais). This is a very interesting discovery,
because the latter species has been known hitherto only from a single skull,
and its validity has been frequently questioned. The Annisquam specimen, as will
be seen later, presents characters which appear to ally it to <i>M. densirostris</i>.</p>

<p>The only specimen from the Atlantic coast of the United States which can
with certainty be referred to this species is the one from Nantucket mentioned on
page 3. Prof. L. Agassiz&rsquo;s original notice of it is so brief that it is quoted in full
below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Agassiz also brought to the notice of the Society the discovery of a Cetacean, new to
America. The skull was exhibited, and its peculiar features pointed out. It was obtained on the
coast of Nantucket by Messrs. H. M. and S. C. Martin, of Roxbury. It belonged to the genus <i>Mesoplodon</i>,
as characterized by Gervais, and ought to be separated from the fossil <i>Ziphius</i>, described by Cuvier.
Professor Agassiz, however, questioned whether <i>Mesoplodon</i> was not identical with <i>Delphinorhynchus</i>,
previously described by De Blainville. The specimen found at Nantucket measured 16 feet in length.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>SKULL.</h4>
<p>The skull of this Nantucket specimen, which I have before me, is thoroughly
adult. That the specimen is a female is probable from the fact that the teeth (one
of which is preserved), though fully developed, are only two-thirds as broad and
three-fourths as long as those of Sowerby&rsquo;s specimen (the type of the species),
which was an adult male.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> The skull is 765 mm. long, and about 30 mm. are lacking
from the end of the beak, so that the original length was about 795 mm. It
appears to be, therefore, rather the largest skull of the species of which there is any
record. The specimen itself, according to Dr. J. A. Allen, was 16 feet 3 inches
long.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> The largest European skull appears to be the one in the Edinburgh Museum,
described by Sir William Turner in 1872.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> The length of this is 749 mm. The
specimen was a female, but though the skull is so large, the mesirostral cartilage was
not ossified, and the individual was, therefore, probably not thoroughly adult.
Two other European specimens, of which the total length was almost identical
with that of the Nantucket specimen, were (1) the adult female obtained at Overstrand,
England, in 1892, and recorded by Southwell and Harmer<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> (length 16 feet
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
2 inches, straight); (2) the adult male obtained at Brodie House, Scotland, in
1800, and recorded by Sowerby<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> (length 16 feet). The length of the skull is not
given for either of these specimens. The adult male obtained at Rugsund, Norway,
in 1901, and recorded by Grieg,<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> was only 15 feet 1 inch long, but some of the
measurements of the skull are as large as, or even a little larger than, those of the
Nantucket skull. The total length of the skull was not given, as the end of the
beak was lacking.</p>
<p>Grieg&rsquo;s figures of the Rugsund skull afford a very satisfactory basis for comparisons
between that specimen and the Nantucket skull (<a href="#Plate_1">Pl. 1</a>, fig. 1). Both
skulls show the comparatively narrow frontal region, the moderately developed
tubercle anterior to the anteorbital notch, and the low maxillary ridge, which are
characteristic of the species. In both skulls the anterior prolongation of the ethmoid
is lanceolate and flat, but in the Rugsund skull the apex is truncated. In
the latter also the posterior end of the mesirostral ossification is divided into three
longitudinal sections by two lateral and somewhat divergent grooves, while in the
Nantucket skull there is only a single median groove. These differences may safely
be regarded as individual. Toward the distal end the surface of the ossification in
the Nantucket is pitted and irregular and descends much below the level of the
premaxill&aelig;. It ends distally at the same point with the vomer. In this skull the
proximal end of the premaxill&aelig; and adjoining plate of the maxill&aelig; are somewhat
less reflexed than in the Rugsund skull. The shape of the superior margin of the
supraoccipital is alike in both.</p>
<p>There are no well-defined differences in the relative thickness of the beak at the
base or in the form and position of the visible portion of the palatines, but in the
Nantucket skull the mass of the combined frontal and lachrymal anterior to the
orbit is less rounded and more triangular than in the Rugsund skull. The temporal
foss&aelig; also have a postero-superior angular enlargement not seen in the latter.</p>
<p>In the Nantucket skull the rostral portion of the premaxill&aelig; is high and at the
distal end vertical. The superior profile is somewhat convex, and the superior free
margin rounded proximally, but sharp distally. The least distance between the
free margins is 10 mm.</p>
<p>The pterygoids are cut off from the maxill&aelig; anteriorly by a very narrow band
of the palatine, which connects with a broad band externally and a lanceolate segment
internally. The inferior pterygoid ridges diverge anteriorly. The broad surface
internal to them is concave. The external border of the pterygoid sinus is
nearly straight. An elongated, fusiform section of the vomer is visible on the inferior
surface of the beak at the middle for a distance of 158 mm., and a small lozenge-shaped
section, ill defined, is visible between the pterygoids and palatines. (<a href="#Plate_4">Pl. 4</a>,
fig. 1.)</p>
<p>The expanded anterior end of the malar is rhomboidal in form, with an external
free margin 11 mm. long. Anteriorly it does not form part of the margin of the
anteorbital notch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>The lachrymal is irregularly oblong, with an external free margin 35 mm. long
and 12 mm. thick. The distance from the anteorbital notch to the anterior end of
the orbit is 60 mm. (<a href="#Plate_7">Pl. 7</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<p>The lateral free margins of the basioccipital are extended posteriorly beyond
the exoccipitals, which is a character indicative of age.</p>
<p>The supraoccipital has a distinct median ridge, with a longitudinal depression
on each side, bounded externally by a prominent convexity. (<a href="#Plate_10">Pl. 10</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<h4>MANDIBLE.</h4>
<p>The mandible is slender, with a very elongate symphysis, which measures 237
mm. The inferior outline of the ramus is strongly concave at the middle and
slightly convex posteriorly, while the symphysial portion is bent upward. The
superior outline is concave both behind and before the tooth, and also immediately
anterior to the coronoid process. At about the beginning of the posterior fourth
the outline is convex, and the mandible at this point is nearly as deep as at the
coronoid process. The superior surface of the symphysis slopes down on each side
to the median line, but each half of the surface is itself nearly plane. (<a href="#Plate_11">Pl. 11</a>, figs.
1, 2, and 5.)</p>
<p>The alveolar groove anterior to the tooth is very distinct throughout and is
without septa and open at the bottom. It ends distally in a rounded aperture
6 mm. in diameter, below which are several small foramina. These lead to a very
large canal which occupies all the symphysial portion of the mandible, the walls
being comparatively thin. Behind the tooth the alveolar groove becomes narrower
gradually and disappears in a length of about 140 mm.</p>
<p>The mental foramen is situated in line with the anterior base of the tooth, and
is confluent with a groove which extends forward for about 80 mm. A rather
shallow groove runs along the inferior margin of the symphysis.</p>
<p>The coronoid process is erect and rounded, and is joined by a horizontal ridge
anteriorly.</p>
<h4>TEETH.</h4>
<p>The mandibular tooth, which is shown in <a href="#Plate_2">Pl. 2</a>, fig. 3, is preserved on the right
side only. Its dimensions are as follows: Length anteriorly in a straight line, 75
mm.; length from the apex to the posterior end of the root, straight, 60; greatest
antero-posterior breadth, 28; transverse thickness, 10; height of apex above
internal superior margin of jaw when tooth is in situ,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> 22; antero-posterior length
of base of exposed portion, 30; distance from anterior end to posterior end of root,
37; greatest height of the exposed dentine crown, above the cement, 14; length
of the base of the dentine crown, 12.</p>
<p>This tooth, as already stated, is only two-thirds as broad and three-fourths
as long as that of Sowerby&rsquo;s Brodie House specimen (the type of the species),
which was an adult male, and leads to the belief that the Nantucket specimen was
a female. This is in a manner confirmed by the Rugsund specimen, which was an
adult male and had teeth as large as Sowerby&rsquo;s specimen. It has to be remarked,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
however, that in the Overstrand, England, specimen (1892), which was an adult
female, the teeth did not project beyond the gums. Messrs. Southwell and Harmer
say regarding it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jaws were apparently completely edentulous, and although it was possible to feel through the
gums a slight prominence on either side in the position of the teeth of the male, we could not by this
means definitely satisfy ourselves with respect to this point, nor were we able to ascertain the presence
of any other rudimentary teeth in either jaw. The evidence which exists on this subject is favourable
to the view that the female of this species is not provided with any teeth which are large enough to
pierce the gums.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is probable that the teeth in the Nantucket specimen, though quite large,
did not project beyond the gums any considerable distance. The external border
of the alveolar groove behind the tooth is only 20 mm. below the apex of the tooth,
and it is not unlikely that the gums in a specimen of this size had nearly that thickness,
so that only the tip of the tooth would project beyond them. Though the
apex is acute, it has a flat abraded surface anteriorly, which, however, is but 4 mm.
long. It seems probable, on the whole, that the teeth in the female may be quite
large without projecting more than a few millimeters beyond the gums.</p>
<p>In shape the tooth of the Nantucket specimen is almost identical with that of
Sowerby&rsquo;s Brodie House adult male, as figured by Lankester. The dentine at the
apex is more nearly white than the cement which surrounds it. The superior
margin of the latter is not a plain ring, but sends upward a papilliform projection
on each side. The dentine itself has two vertical grooves on each side. The root
of the tooth ends very obliquely and is rugose and irregular. The cavity is closed.</p>
<p>Grieg remarks as follows regarding the structure of the teeth of the Rugsund
specimen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sections and microscopic preparations of the alveolar tooth of this whale show that its apex consists
of dentine, within which is found an inner pulp cavity 4 mm. long and 1 mm. broad. The dentine,
the structure of which agrees with that which Turner found in <i>Mesoplodon bidens</i> and <i>Mesoplodon layardi</i>,
is yellowish white, with the exception of the part nearest the pulp cavity, which is yellowish brown. It
seems to correspond most closely to what Ray Lankester called osteodentine. Throughout the tooth the
dentine is covered with a very thin layer of shining white enamel. The enamel is, however, lacking on
the front of the tooth, having probably been worn away. A section through the middle of the tooth, at
right angles with the V-shaped furrow, shows a yellowish cement layer from 3 to 5 mm. broad, which is,
however, worn away on the front of the tooth. Within the cement layer is a white, amorphous, calcareous
mass, forming a band from 1.5 to 3.5 mm. broad, which appears to correspond to Ray Lankester&rsquo;s &ldquo;globular
matter&rdquo; and Turner&rsquo;s &ldquo;modified vasodentine.&rdquo; The mass seems to agree most closely with Ray
Lankester&rsquo;s &ldquo;globular matter,&rdquo; as it has &ldquo;no structure excepting an indistinct botryoidal character visible
with a low magnifying power.&rdquo; The core of the tooth consists of dentine, the inner layer of which
is brownish, while the outer is rather whitish yellow. As above mentioned, the dentine is visible on
the front of the tooth, since both the cement and the amorphous, calcareous mass are worn away. Moreover,
it is clear that on the front of the tooth the dentine is not covered by enamel. The pulp cavity is
reduced to a fine pore. A section across the root of the tooth shows an outer yellowish cement layer,
from 2 to 5 mm. broad, while the interior of the tooth is filled with a white, amorphous, calcareous mass,
which is interspersed with thin yellowish lamell&aelig; of dentine. Here and there, also, thin lamell&aelig; are
seen to extend from the outer cement layer into the white, amorphous, calcareous mass. The dentine
lamell&aelig; appear to be identical with what Ray Lankester calls osteodentine. No pulp cavity is visible
in the root of the tooth.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>

<h3 id="c5">MESOPLODON DENSIROSTRIS (Blainville)?</h3>
<dl class="undent"><dd><i>Delphinus densirostris</i> <span class="sc">Blainville</span>, Nouv. Dict. Hist. Nat., 2d ed., vol. 9, 1817, p. 178.</dd>
<dd><i>Ziphius seychellensis</i> <span class="sc">Gray</span>, Zo&ouml;l. <i>Erebus and Terror</i>, 1846, p. 28.</dd></dl>
<p>The skull of the specimen from Annisquam, Mass., (<a href="#Plate_1">Pl. 1</a>, fig. 2) is, I regret
to say, in rather poor condition. It is broken in the left orbital region, and all
the bones, especially those of the beak, are warped by weathering. The proximal
extremity of the left premaxilla is lacking and also the tip of the beak.</p>
<p>The skull is obviously that of a young animal, as all the sutures are open and
the surface of the occipital condyles is pitted, owing to imperfect ossification.</p>
<p>Although the dimensions of the skull, with a few exceptions, agree well with
those of young specimens of <i>M. bidens</i>, as shown by the foregoing table (p. 8),
certain differences stand out conspicuously. The most salient of these is the depth
of the beak as a whole and the depth and shape of the rostral portion of the premaxill&aelig;.
The latter portion of the premaxill&aelig; instead of being low, with a straight
inferior margin, is very high, with the inferior margin strongly convex. At the
middle of the beak the premaxill&aelig; are higher than the maxill&aelig; on which they rest.
It is true that the shape of the beak varies greatly with age in <i>bidens</i> and other
species of <i>Mesoplodon</i>, but I do not find any evidence that such a change as is here
indicated takes place in <i>bidens</i>. The form of the beak and of the rostral portion
of the premaxill&aelig; is that of <i>M. densirostris</i>.</p>
<p>The beak is almost as broad at the base as in <i>bidens</i>, but the lateral free margin
of the maxilla anterior to the anteorbital notch instead of continuing along the side
of the beak nearly to the tip, as in <i>bidens</i>, ends at a point about 90 mm. in front
of the line of the notch, beyond which the sides of the beak are vertical.</p>
<p>The margin of the maxilla immediately anterior to the anteorbital notch is a
little damaged, but there was apparently no strong tubercle at this point, and the
surface of the maxilla, though convex, is not raised into a distinct ridge. In a
young skull, however, one would not expect to find a high ridge. The palatines
are visible from above, which is not the case in <i>bidens</i>.</p>
<p>The maxillary foramen is situated a little in advance of the premaxillary
foramen and is directed forward, and, as Dr. Glover M. Allen has pointed out,
connects with a broad groove which runs forward along the triangular, horizontal
portion of the maxilla at the base of the beak. The maxill&aelig; are much broader
behind the notch than in <i>bidens</i>, and the anterior end of the malar forms the bottom
of the notch. The premaxill&aelig; are noticeably constricted immediately in front of
the premaxillary foramina, and the expanded portion just behind these foramina
is nearly horizontal, with a low transverse ridge near the middle. The proximal
end of the premaxill&aelig; is nearly vertical. The anterior nares are noticeably small.
The foramen magnum is large, with a trifoliate outline (<a href="#Plate_10">Pl. 10</a>, fig. 2). The palate
at the proximal end presents a median ridge with a narrow groove on each side.
The palatines extend as a broad band much beyond the pterygoids anteriorly.
The vomer is visible below for a space of 142 mm. near the end of the beak. A
very small piece is also visible at the base of the beak, between the palatines and
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
pterygoids. The inferior surface of the pterygoids is convex on the side adjoining
the lateral free margin (<a href="#Plate_4">Pl. 4</a>, fig. 2).</p>
<p>This skull is peculiar in that there is no very distinct basirostral groove and that
the basirostral ridge, as already stated, extends forward only about 90 mm. Below
this ridge is a shallow broad groove which narrows rapidly forward and can be traced
to the extremity of the beak, where it broadens out somewhat (<a href="#Plate_7">Pl. 7</a>, fig. 2).</p>
<p>While this skull agrees in size and in many of its proportions with similar skulls
of <i>M. bidens</i>, it differs from that species and agrees with <i>M. densirostris</i> in the breadth
across the anteorbital region, in the depth of the beak and its shape at the base, in
the shape of the premaxill&aelig; both distally and proximally, in the direction of the
maxillary foramen, and the shape of the maxillary bone in front of the same, in the
occupation of the base of the maxillary notch by the anterior end of the malar, in the
absence of any distinct maxillary ridge above the notch, in the forward extension of
the palatines, and in the shape of the foramen magnum.</p>
<p>Flower states that there is a deep basirostral groove in
<i>M. densirostris</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> but
neither the figure in Gervais&rsquo; Zoologie et Paleontologie Fran&ccedil;aise,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> nor that in Van
Beneden and Gervais&rsquo; Ost&eacute;ographie des C&eacute;tac&eacute;s,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> shows such a groove. The conformation
of the base of the rostrum appears to be about the same as in the Annisquam
skull.</p>
<p>In regard to differences between this skull and those of <i>M. densirostris</i> it should
be stated that in the latter the premaxillary foramina are situated farther apart, and
that the maxillary foramina are situated considerably in advance of those of the
premaxill&aelig; instead of nearly in line with them.</p>
<p>The Annisquam skull approaches <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> in several characters, but these
are such as <i>europ&aelig;us</i> shares with <i>densirostris</i>. The principal ones are the breadth
of the maxill&aelig; in front of the orbits, the presence of the malar in the base of the
anteorbital notch, and the convexity of a part of the inferior surface of the pterygoids.</p>
<p>Dr. Glover M. Allen has given an account of the exterior, skeleton, and teeth of
this specimen, from which the following particulars are extracted:<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the Annisquam specimen no color notes were taken, but from a few small photographs
in the possession of the Boston Society of Natural History, it appears evident that the ventral portion
was of a lighter tint, and in one of the views a few oval whitish spots are seen on the side a trifle behind
the middle portion of the body. Another view shows the convexity of the posterior margin of the flukes
at the median point, as well as the prominent dorsal fin. The lower jaw protruded slightly beyond the
upper. Measurements of this specimen, as noted by Professor Hyatt, are as follows: Total length, 12
feet 2 inches; from anus to bight of flukes, 3 feet 4 to 6 inches; across flukes, 3 feet 1 inch; from tip of
rostrum to angle of mouth, 1 foot 1&frac12; inches. The gular furrows were noted as about 10 inches long and
from &frac14; to &frac12; an inch deep.</p>
<p>The teeth of the Annisquam specimen barely projected above the alveoli of the jaws and are sharply
mucronate. The basal portion of each, however, is more like that of the male&rsquo;s tooth [<i>M. europ&aelig;us</i>]
in the slightly convex posterior outline and the forward extension of the anterior angle. * * *</p>
<p>The Annisquam skeleton has 45 vertebr&aelig;. Four of the seven cervicals are fused. The atlas, axis,
and third cervical are firmly anchylosed throughout, save for the lateral foramina for the passage of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
cervical nerves. The fourth cervical is fused to the third by the dorsal spine on the left side and by the
tip of the upper lateral process of the same side. Its centrum, right half of the dorsal spine (the spine
is divided medially), and the remaining lateral processes are free. * * * The epiphyses of the fourth
and fifth cervical vertebr&aelig; and the anterior epiphysis of the sixth cervical are fused to their respective
centra, but all the other epiphyses of the vertebral column and of the pectoral limbs are free.</p>
<p>The Annisquam skeleton has nine dorsal vertebr&aelig; with their corresponding pairs of ribs. * * *
The sternum of this specimen presents few points of interest. It consists of four pieces, the anterior-most
of which is largest, slightly hollowed above, and correspondingly convex below. The three
remaining pieces are nearly flat, with a deep median notch at the anterior and posterior border of each.
The posterior piece evidently represents a fusion of the elements of two segments, as there are articular
surfaces for two pairs of ribs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the foregoing, it appears that the Annisquam specimen probably had one
or two vertebr&aelig; less than <i>bidens</i> or <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, and that the sternum was somewhat
differently shaped. The tooth, which is figured by Doctor Allen, is conical, compressed,
54 mm. long, 30 broad at the base, and resembles teeth of immature <i>bidens</i>.</p>
<p>Although with such scant material it is not possible to determine satisfactorily
the identity of this third species of <i>Mesoplodon</i> in the North Atlantic, represented
by the Annisquam specimen, I feel convinced that that specimen does not belong
to <i>M. bidens</i> and that there is a strong probability that it belongs to <i>M. densirostris</i>.
It is true that the latter species has been found hitherto only in the Indian Ocean
and about Australia, but we know so little about the distribution of the ziphioid
whales that, in my opinion, that circumstance by itself should not be given very
great weight.</p>

<dl class="undent"><dd><i>Dioplodon europ&aelig;us</i> <span class="sc">Gervais</span>, Zool. et Pal. fran&ccedil;., 1st ed., vol. 2, 1848-1852, p. 4; 2d ed., 1859, p. 289, pl. 40, figs. 3-6.</dd>

<dd><i>Neoziphius europ&aelig;us</i> <span class="sc">Gray</span>, Suppl. Cat. Seals and Whales Brit. Mus., 1871, p. 101.</dd></dl>
<p>This species was based on a single specimen found floating in the English
Channel about seventy years ago. An account of the circumstances under which
it was found was given by Eug&egrave;ne Deslongchamps in 1866, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The head, which forms the subject of this last note, was given to my father some twenty-five or
thirty years ago by Mr. Abel Vautier, a merchant and armorer of our town, who died at Paris two years
since.</p>
<p>The captain of one of Mr. Vautier&rsquo;s ships, on his return from a voyage to the colonies, saw floating
on the water, at the entrance to the English Channel, the body of a large animal entirely covered by birds
(large and small gulls, etc.), which were devouring it. The ship approached the stray, and the captain,
knowing that Mr. Abel Vautier was greatly interested in natural objects, had the head of the cetacean cut
off, fastened it securely with a cord, and let it trail behind the ship. When he arrived at Ca&euml;n he made
a present of it to Mr. Vautier. The piece had at that time an appearance anything but agreeable. Mr.
Vautier was especially fond of beautiful objects which please the eye, and hence he offered it to my
father, saying, &ldquo;You, who are an anatomist, can make better use of this than I can.&rdquo; My father was
unwilling to refuse the present, but neither he nor Mr. Vautier knew as yet of its extreme rarity. It is
in fact, up to the present time, the only specimen which exists, and is a unique object in
collections.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>No additional specimens have been recorded from European waters or elsewhere,
and much doubt has been thrown on the validity of the species, many zoologists
regarding it as an adult of the commoner species <i>M. bidens</i>. Van Beneden
remarked in 1888:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The opinions of naturalists are divided as regards the identity of this ziphioid, which is unique up
to the present time. In the eyes of some it represents an old male of the common <i>Mesoplodon</i>, in which
the tooth, instead of developing near the middle of the jaw, has developed near the anterior extremity.
This is the opinion of Doctor Fischer and others, who think that this unique specimen represents merely
an individual modification and that consequently it should not figure in the list of species. We do not
share this opinion. It is not impossible that this ziphioid may belong to the other hemisphere, and this
would explain why only one single individual has been captured in
Europe.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the original specimen,
it is of great interest to find that two of the specimens from the east coast of the
United States represent the same species. As one of them is adult and the other
young, the view that the type of <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> is merely an old individual of <i>M. bidens</i>
is satisfactorily disposed of, as is also the opinion that it represents a singular
individual variation.</p>
<p>The two American specimens which represent <i>europ&aelig;us</i> are those from North
Long Branch, New Jersey (adult female; skull, lacking rostrum and mandible, in
the Museum of Comparative Zoology), and from Atlantic City, New Jersey (young
male; skeleton, cast and photographs in the U. S. National Museum, Cat. No. 23346).</p>
<h4>SPECIFIC CHARACTERS.</h4>
<p>The species <i>europ&aelig;us</i> differs from <i>bidens</i> in the following characters, which may
be regarded as diagnostic:</p>
<p>Size larger and pectoral limbs relatively shorter and narrower.</p>
<p>The expanded portion of the maxill&aelig; and frontals broader in front of the orbit.
The protuberance which projects into the anteorbital notch much larger and the
ridge on the maxilla which extends backward from it much higher. Distance from
inner margin of maxillary foramen to tip of protuberance much more than one-half
the distance between the maxillary foramina of the two sides. Rostrum deeper at
the base. Inferior surface of pterygoids more or less convex, with a ridge (in adults)
running diagonally across it.</p>
<p>The cranial characters above enumerated are found in the type-skull, as will
be seen by examining the excellent figures in Van Beneden and Gervais&rsquo; Osteography,
plate 24.</p>
<p>In Dr. Glover M. Allen&rsquo;s account of the Long Branch specimen<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
it is stated
that the fishermen who measured it reported that it was 22 feet long, while none of
the European specimens (some of which were certainly adults) was more than 16&frac12;
feet long. That the measurement reported by the fishermen is at least approximately
correct appears from the fact that the skull is larger than that of any of the
European specimens. The beak is missing, so that the total length of the skull can
not be given, but the distance from the occipital condyles to the line of the maxillary
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
notches (straight) is 312 mm., while in the largest adult among the European specimens
this distance is only 260 mm., and in the thoroughly adult Nantucket specimen
282 mm.</p>
<h4>SKULL.</h4>
<p>The Atlantic City and Long Branch skulls also agree in numerous other details
of structure in addition to the foregoing, the more important of which will now be
mentioned. Unless otherwise stated, the type-skull, as shown by Van Beneden and
Gervais&rsquo; figures,<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
also presents the same peculiarities in contrast with <i>M. bidens</i>.</p>
<p><i>Dorsal aspect</i> (<a href="#Plate_2">Pl. 2</a>, figs. 1 and 2).&mdash;The premaxill&aelig; are more depressed immediately
in front of the blowhole than in <i>M. bidens</i>, which, with the prominence of
the maxillary ridges, makes this whole region appear strongly concave. The blowhole
is narrower absolutely and also relatively to the breadth of the expanded
proximal ends of the premaxill&aelig;, so that while in <i>bidens</i> the breadth of the blowhole
is much more than one-third the breadth across the proximal ends of the premaxill&aelig;,
in <i>europ&aelig;us</i> it is considerably less than a third. Both premaxill&aelig; are much constricted
on the sides of the blowhole and the effect is heightened by the greater
expansion of the proximal ends of the former. These ends do not fit closely against
the adjoining edge of the maxill&aelig; as in <i>bidens</i>, but leave a transverse vacuity, or
trough, which is especially noticeable in the type-skull. The anterior end of the
malar bone occupies the bottom of the maxillary notch and a small portion of it is
visible from above, while in <i>bidens</i> it does not extend up into the notch at all from
the inferior surface and is not visible from above. The posterior margin of the
maxill&aelig; is more squared in <i>europ&aelig;us</i> than in <i>bidens</i>.</p>
<p>The margins of the beak, formed by the maxill&aelig;, instead of being straight, are
somewhat emarginate a little posterior to the middle of the length and somewhat
convex anterior to it, which gives the contour of the beak, seen from above, a
different shape from that of <i>bidens</i>. In the type-skull of <i>europ&aelig;us</i> the mesirostral
ossification appears to be higher at the proximal end than the premaxill&aelig;, and
distally extends to the end of the beak. In <i>bidens</i> it is lower than the premaxill&aelig;
and, in the Nantucket skull at least, ends anteriorly at the same point as the vomer,
or, in other words, much behind the end of the beak. It would appear from the
statements of Sir William Turner, Van Beneden and Gervais, Grieg, and others,
that the mesirostral ossification never reaches the end of the beak in <i>bidens</i>, but it
does in <i>grayi</i>, <i>haasti</i>, <i>densirostris</i>, and many fossil species, as well as in <i>europ&aelig;us</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lateral aspect</i> (<a href="#Plate_8">Pl. 8</a>, figs. 1, 2).&mdash;The temporal foss&aelig; are a little longer than
the orbit in <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, but a little shorter than the orbit in <i>bidens</i>; in the former the
superior margin is flat or a little concave, rather than convex. The exoccipital
extends in an angle farther forward in <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, and the suture between it and the
zygomatic is, in consequence, less nearly vertical than in <i>bidens</i>. The premaxill&aelig;
at the sides of the blowhole are nearly horizontal, so that their superior surface is
little seen from this aspect, while in <i>bidens</i> they slope downward, so that the whole
of the superior surface is visible. The high maxillary ridge, situated behind the
anteorbital notch, is very noticeable from this point of view, as it shuts off a
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
considerable portion of the premaxill&aelig;. The convex inferior outline of the beak
and its great depth at the base are also salient peculiarities.</p>
<p><i>Ventral aspect</i> (<a href="#Plate_5">Pl. 5</a>, figs. 1, 2).&mdash;The anterior ends of the palatine bones are
bifurcated, the inner part being the smaller. The two bones make but a narrow
angle with the median line, instead of a wide one, as in <i>bidens</i>, and the surface of the
maxill&aelig; between them is strongly convex instead of flat. This convexity is narrowed
at both ends, or, in other words, is fusiform in shape. No similar conformation is
found in <i>bidens</i>, in which the inferior basal area of the maxill&aelig; is flat.</p>
<p>In the young Atlantic City skull of <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, the vomer is visible as a small,
narrow, club-shaped piece, 68 mm. long. Anteriorly it joins the premaxill&aelig;, which
form a prominent ridge in the median line. On each side of this ridge is a wide
and quite deep groove. As the beak is lacking in the adult North Long Branch
skull, its peculiarities can not be made known. In the type-skull the form is the
same as in the Atlantic City skull, but the vomer does not appear at all on the
palate. In <i>bidens</i> the shape of the inferior surface of the premaxill&aelig; at the distal
end is quite different. A very narrow groove runs parallel with and close to the
median line and the whole surface external to it is more or less convex.</p>
<h4>MANDIBLE.</h4>
<p>The mandible of the Atlantic City specimen of <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> resembles that of
the type, as figured by Van Beneden and Gervais, in the shortness of the symphysis
and in the position of the tooth, which is in advance of the posterior end of the
symphysis. A number of differences, however, require consideration. (<a href="#Plate_11">Pl. 11</a>,
figs. 3 and 6.)</p>
<p>In the type, the symphysis, as shown by Van Beneden and Gervais&rsquo; figure,
plate 24, fig. 2<i>a</i>, is a little more than one-fifth the length of the mandible. The
same relative proportion is found in the Atlantic City specimen, but, as the latter
is a younger individual, one would expect the symphysis to be shorter. The figure
of Van Beneden and Gervais gives the impression that in the type the end of the
mandible is broken, and that, hence, the symphysis is shorter than it was originally.
It will be observed that figures 2 and 2<i>a</i> do not agree as regards the length between
the tooth and the end of the jaw, figure 2<i>a</i> showing a greater length. In figure 2,
however, the jaw seems rather too long for the cranium, and if the greater length
of the symphysis shown in figure 2<i>a</i> were introduced, it would certainly be so. The
explanation of this discrepancy is not readily found; but one may be allowed to
think that the symphysis is not so blunt in the type as is shown in figure 2.</p>
<p>In the Atlantic City specimen the superior lateral free margin of the symphysis
is straight, while in the type it is much elevated. This is no doubt due to difference
in age and possibly in sex. The type shows three or four mental foramina,
while the Atlantic City specimen has one large posterior one and seven smaller
ones anterior to it.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of the latter specimen is that the coronoid process is
situated much in advance of the condyle, while the angle extends considerably
behind it. In the type both are nearly in line with the condyle. I am unable to
explain this difference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>In the Atlantic City specimen the axis of the tooth where it emerges from
the alveolus is 91 mm. from the end of the jaw. The portion of the tooth above
the alveolus is 11 mm. long at the base and 12 mm. high. It is conical and sharp
pointed, and is inclined forward and a little outward, especially at the tip. At the
alveolus the transverse breadth of the tooth is 5 mm. The much larger tooth
in the type indicates that that specimen was a male.</p>
<p>The mandible of the Atlantic City specimen of <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> differs from that
of <i>M. bidens</i> in the relative shortness of the symphysis, the large number of mental
foramina, the more anterior position of the tooth, and the direction of the crown,
which is forward instead of backward.</p>

<p>Although the skeleton of <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> appears from the foregoing formula to
include one less thoracic vertebra than those of <i>M. bidens</i>, as the last pair of ribs
present is as long as the preceding ones, an additional pair probably existed originally.
The formula for <i>europ&aelig;us</i> would then be: C. 7, Th. 10, L. 10, Ca. 20 = 47.
(<a href="#Plate_13">Pl. 13</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<p>In the Atlantic City specimen all the epiphyses are free. The atlas and axis
are anchylosed together, the third cervical is united to the axis by the centrum,
and on the right side by the top of the neural arch; on the left side the arch is
imperfect and free. The fourth to the seventh cervicals, inclusive, are all free.
The arch is incomplete above in the fourth, fifth, and sixth, but complete in the
seventh. There is a short neural spine on both sixth and seventh cervicals. The
atlas has a broad, obliquely-truncated inferior lateral process, but no superior
process, while the axis has both inferior and superior processes. The inferior
process is twice as long as the superior process, and both are directed backward.
They do not meet to form a ring. The third to the sixth cervicals, inclusive,
have inferior processes only, that on the third being long and thin (but developed
on the left side only). On the fourth and fifth cervicals the processes are short
and small; on the sixth, long and broad, and directed downward. The centrum
of the seventh cervical has a broad facet on the side, where the first rib is attached,
and an inferior lateral process thicker than that of the sixth cervical, but also
directed downward.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether the foregoing characters of the cervical vertebr&aelig; are of
any systematic importance, as there is a very large amount of individual variation
among these animals in the development of the transverse processes and other
details of structure. <i>M. bidens</i>, however, appears to have superior transverse
processes on most of the cervicals which sometimes unite with the inferior processes
to form foramina. In the specimen of <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> under consideration there
are no superior processes, except on the axis.</p>
<p>Metapophyses are first distinguishable on the diapophyses of the fourth thoracic
vertebra, and on the seventh assume the form of conical tubercles. On the eighth
and following vertebr&aelig; they are flat, and are last distinguishable on the seventh
caudal vertebra. Facets for the articulation of the tubercles of the ribs occur on
the diapophyses of the first to the seventh thoracic vertebr&aelig;. On the latter vertebra
the first transverse process appears as a short projection on the side of the centrum.
On the eighth thoracic vertebra, the transverse process is broad and flat, with the
anterior margin bent upward, and is about 48 mm. long. The base of the neural
arch is strongly concave externally. The transverse process of the ninth thoracic
vertebra is similar to the preceding one, but broader and not bent upward anteriorly.
The base of the neural arch is also concave in this vertebra. The ends of the transverse
processes of the eighth and ninth vertebr&aelig; are emarginate for the articulation
of the ribs. A median inferior ridge is first distinguishable on the seventh thoracic
vertebra.</p>
<p>As far as can be learned from the descriptions of Turner, Grieg, and others,
the thoracic vertebr&aelig; of <i>europ&aelig;us</i> do not present any marked differences from those
of <i>bidens</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>The transverse processes of the lumbar vertebr&aelig; are short, broad, and flat, and
somewhat curved forward. They are expanded and rounded at the free ends.
The centra increase in length posteriorly, the last lumbar having the greatest length
of any vertebra in the column. The neural spines increase in length from the first
lumbar to the fourth, those on the remaining lumbars being subequal, but the spine
on the ninth lumbar is a little longer than the others. Median inferior ridges occur
on all the lumbars and are strongest at the middle of the series. The height of the
centrum of the ninth lumbar is 63 mm., width 73, and length 116. The highest
neural spine is 233.</p>
<p>As above mentioned, the first of the vertebr&aelig; counted among the lumbars
may be the last thoracic vertebra, but as there is no indication of an articular facet
at the end of the transverse process it is not so considered in this place.</p>
<p>The lumbar vertebr&aelig; in <i>M. bidens</i> appears to be more nearly equal in length
than in the present species, but are not different otherwise.</p>
<p>The spines of the caudal vertebr&aelig; decrease rapidly in height posteriorly, and
disappear after the tenth caudal. The transverse processes resemble those of the
lumbars, but are shorter. They are last distinguishable on the eighth caudal. The
transverse process of the seventh caudal is perforated by a vertical foramen. Similar
but much smaller foramina occur on the sides of the centra of the eighth and ninth
caudals. In these vertebr&aelig; the inferior ridges are also pierced by foramina. In the
fourth caudal a ridge appears on the side of the neural arch on a level with the top
of the centrum, and similar ridges are found on the succeeding vertebr&aelig; as far as
the ninth caudal. The last ten vertebr&aelig; are without processes or neural arches.</p>
<p>Sir William Turner states that the caudals of <i>M. bidens</i> are without vertical
foramina, but the figure in Van Beneden and Gervais&rsquo; Osteography (plate 22) shows
them in the same position as in <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i>. The inferior ridges, however, appear
to be imperforate in the former species.</p>
<h4>RIBS.</h4>
<p>The first seven pairs of ribs have both tubercle and head. The first is nearly
as long as the second, and is very broad at the proximal end. In the seventh pair
the head is double, one facet of the rib articulating with the facet on the posterior
margin of the centrum of the sixth thoracic vertebra and the other with the short
transverse process on the side of the centrum of the seventh thoracic vertebra. The
eighth and ninth pairs of ribs articulate only with the transverse processes of the
eighth and ninth thoracic vertebr&aelig;, respectively. The ninth pair of ribs, as already
stated, is nearly or quite as long as the eighth, from which it seems probable that a
tenth short pair was present originally. There is, however, no trace of a facet for
the articulation of such a rib on the end of the transverse process of what appears
to be the first lumbar vertebra.</p>
<p>The only difference between the ribs of <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> and those of <i>M. bidens</i>
appears to be that the first pair is much longer proportionately in the former species.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<h4>STERNUM.</h4>
<p>The sternum presents no differences of importance from that of <i>M. bidens</i>
figured by Grieg,<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a>
except that the fourth and fifth segments are anchylosed together,
both laterally and transversely, and that the two sides are symmetrical. (<a href="#Plate_13">Pl. 13</a>,
fig. 2.)</p>
<h4>PECTORAL LIMB.</h4>
<p>The scapula of <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> presents an entirely different appearance from
that of <i>M. bidens</i> as figured in Van Beneden and Gervais&rsquo; Osteography (plate 22).
In <i>europ&aelig;us</i> the scapula is very high anteriorly, the anterior border is convex forward
and the anterior crest convex backward, bounding an elongated elliptical area.
The posterior margin is straight. The acromion is short, with convex margins at
the base, beyond which it narrows suddenly and terminates in a straight, cylindrical
process, which is strongly inclined upward. The coracoid is as long as the acromion,
nearly straight and horizontal, but expanded at the end. (<a href="#Plate_13">Pl. 13</a>, figs. 3, 4.)</p>
<p>The phalangeal formula of the Atlantic City specimen of <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> and those
of three Norwegian specimens of <i>M. bidens</i> are as follows (the metacarpals being
included):</p>

<p>In <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> the metacarpal of the third digit is much constricted in the
middle. The shaft of the ulna is straight. Except in these particulars and the
relatively small size of the whole pectoral limb, the latter appears not to differ
materially from that of <i>M. bidens</i>. As shown above, the first digit in <i>M. bidens</i>
consists of the metacarpal bone only, while in <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i> a phalange is also present.</p>

<h4>HISTORY OF THE ATLANTIC CITY SPECIMEN.</h4>
<p>Regarding the finding of the Atlantic City specimen and its exterior and
gross anatomy, nothing has been published except brief references by Sir William
Turner in 1889<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a>
and Dr. Glover M. Allen in 1906,<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> taken from a newspaper report
of a communication made by myself before the Biological Society of Washington
in 1889. On that account a somewhat detailed statement regarding it will be
made in this place.</p>
<p>This individual (<a href="#Plate_41">Pl. 41</a>, figs. 1, 2) was a male, 12&frac12; feet long. It was observed
by the crew of life-saving station No. 28, near Atlantic City, New Jersey, on the afternoon
of March 28, 1889. It had come inside the bar which skirts the coast at this
point, and was apparently unable to find its way out. It was captured with some
difficulty, after being wounded in the throat, and was dragged up on the beach near
the station. Later in the day it was carried to the skating rink of Messrs. Johnson
&amp; McShea, at Atlantic City, where it was exhibited until Monday, April 1. On
the next morning it was sent by express to Washington.</p>
<p>I examined it for the first time in Atlantic City on March 29. It was then
lying on the floor of the skating rink in such a position that the under surfaces were
concealed, and, as the teeth were not visible, I mistook it for a female. Upon its
arrival in Washington, however, where it could be examined under more favorable
circumstances, it proved to be a male. The following measurements were taken
from the fresh specimen:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h4>EXTERNAL FORM AND COLOR.</h4>
<p>The general form was slender and elongate. The beak sloped gradually from
its extremity to the forehead, and there was no constriction separating the beak
from the remainder of the head. Behind the blowhole, the outline of the back
commenced at a higher level, but immediately curved slightly downward, indicating
the position of the neck. The line then rose gradually until the anterior base of the
dorsal fin was reached. Behind the fin the outline sloped downward gradually to
the flukes.</p>
<p>The dorsal fin was relatively small, falcate, and obtusely terminated. The
distance in front of its anterior base was three-fifths of the total length. Its posterior
margin was continuous with the ridge of the back, which extended to the flukes and
terminated abruptly a little anterior to the middle point of the antero-posterior
breadth of the flukes. In front of the fin the back was rounded.</p>
<p>The pectoral fins were small and were placed low down on the sides. Their
anterior base was as far removed from the eye (in a straight line) as the eye was
from the extremity of the beak. Their shape was somewhat different from that
of the flippers of <i>M. bidens</i> figured by Sir William
Turner.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>
Their anterior margin
was nearly straight throughout; the extremity was evenly and distinctly rounded
off. The posterior margin was slightly convex in the distal half and straight
proximally.</p>
<p>The conformation of the region of the axilla was quite peculiar. The hard
integument of the posterior margin of the flipper was continued proximally inward
and forward to a point near the head of the humerus. The triangular area between
this stiff edge and the side of the body was occupied by a thin, soft, wrinkled skin,
in the middle of which the olecranon could be felt. On the side of the body this
soft integument occupied an area nearly as large as the flipper, the underlying thick
layer of blubber ending abruptly, especially below. A depression was thus formed
in which the flippers could be placed so as to be almost in the same general plane
with surrounding surfaces of the body. They are probably so placed when the
animal is swimming.</p>
<p>The flukes had the general lunate form common to all species of the order. The
posterior margin is not divided in the center. Its middle third was convex; its
lateral thirds concave. In these and other respects the shape of the flukes agreed
closely with Sir William Turner&rsquo;s excellent figure of <i>M. bidens</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a>
The antero-posterior
breadth of the flukes was, however, somewhat greater in proportion to their
transverse breadth than is indicated in this figure. The caudal peduncle terminated
above at a point 6&frac12; inches in front of the posterior margin of the flukes. On
this margin were situated three star-shaped white scars, which appeared to mark
the points of attachment of crustacean parasites.</p>
<p>The margins of the upper jaw were very obtuse posteriorly, the rostrum being
covered with a layer of blubber of gradually increasing thickness. A depression
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
bounded by gradually converging lines extended 4&frac14; inches back of the angle of the
mouth.</p>
<p>The inferior surface of the bony palate extended below the level of the lips,
and the sides of the former were visible upon looking into the mouth laterally.</p>
<p>The blowhole was large and somewhat unsymmetrically placed, the right angle
being the more anterior. The concavity was forward.</p>
<p>The eye was situated a little below the line of the mouth and 20&frac14; inches from
the extremity of the snout.</p>
<p>The external opening of the ear was 2&#8542; inches behind the posterior angle of
the eye, and a little below the line of the lower eyelid.</p>
<p>The two throat-furrows were of unequal length. The left furrow was 6&frac34; inches
long, and its anterior end was distant 8&#8541; inches from the extremity of the jaw. The
right furrow did not extend quite so far forward, and was 7&#8540; inches long.</p>
<p>The furrows converged posteriorly; they were separated by an interval of
&#8541; inches anteriorly and 5&#8539; inches posteriorly. Between the anterior ends of the
main furrows was a small one, about an inch long, but it is doubtful whether this
was a natural fissure. I did not observe it when the whale was in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>The natural color of the specimen had largely disappeared before I examined
it, but Captain Gaskell and others who saw it while still fresh agreed that it was
very dark slate-gray on the back, lighter on the sides, and whitish on the belly. I
observed that a broad area between the pectoral fins was slate-gray, and contrasted
with the white of the throat and belly. The whitish color ended somewhat abruptly
and irregularly at the anus, and the flukes, as well as the pectoral and dorsal fins,
were probably very dark slate-gray, or blackish, when fresh.</p>
<p>The epidermis was exceedingly smooth and glossy throughout.</p>
<p>The tongue was purplish-white. The roof of the mouth was black, except at
the posterior end, where there was an irregular area of pinkish-white.</p>
<p>The integument of the roof of the mouth was smooth and shining. Its surface
was convex at the extremity of the beak, but the central portion was concave,
while at the posterior end it was again raised into a rounded pad. In these respects
the shape of the integuments coincided with that of the underlying maxill&aelig;, upon
which they were closely fitted. The sides were rounded, and a shallow groove intervened
between them and the lips. This groove was continued around the roof of
the mouth behind, and formed a demarcation between this part and the &oelig;sophagus.</p>
<p>The tip of the tongue was 7&frac12; inches from the extremity of the jaw. It was
oval in outline, the extremity is obtuse, and it was entirely bound down. The
margin was entire, and not crenulate, as in many dolphins.</p>
<p>Dorsal and ventral views of the stomach are shown in <a href="#Plate_40">Pl. 40</a>, figs. 1 and 2;
a dorsal view of the lungs in <a href="#Plate_13">Pl. 13</a>, fig. 5; and of the perineum in <a href="#Plate_40">Pl. 40</a>, fig. 3.
A description of the gross anatomy is reserved for a subsequent paper.</p>

<p>Since the foregoing account of <i>europ&aelig;us</i> was written, a description of the
type-skull, with two excellent photographic figures, has been published by L.
Brasil,<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a>
of the Ca&euml;n Museum. A comparison of the figures with those of the Atlantic
City and Long Branch skulls on Pls. <a href="#Plate_2">2</a> and <a href="#Plate_8">8</a> of the present article, confirms
the identification of the latter specimens with <i>M. europ&aelig;us</i>. Besides a brief description
of the type-skull M. Brasil&rsquo;s paper contains measurements and two text figures
of the right mandibular tooth, natural size.</p>
<h3 id="c7">MESOPLODON STEJNEGERI True.</h3>
<dl class="undent"><dd><i>Mesoplodon stejnegeri</i> <span class="sc">True</span>, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., vol. 8, p. 584. Oct. 19, 1885.</dd></dl>
<p>This species was originally described from a single cranium of a young individual,
which was collected by Dr. L. Stejneger on Bering Island, Commander
Group, Bering Sea, in 1883. With but a single skull, the characters of the species
could not be very satisfactorily defined, and some European cetologists have been
inclined to doubt its validity.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a>
In 1904, however, another skull was obtained by
the National Museum, which made it certain that the species was entirely distinct
from <i>M. bidens</i> or other known forms of the genus. Early in the year mentioned
Dr. D. S. Jordan, president of Stanford University, called my attention to a small
whale, which stranded on the coast of Oregon, 1&frac12; miles south of the United States
life-saving station on South Beach, Yaquina Bay, near Newport, in February, and
proved later to represent the present species. Doctor Jordan&rsquo;s information was
obtained from Mr. J. G. Crawford, of Albany, Oregon, who wrote him in part as
follows, under date of March 7, 1904:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Herewith I enclose a stereograph of a head of a member of the whale family, which I made at
Yaquina Bay, Oregon. The animal was 17 feet long, with fluked tail, soft, smooth skin, blowhole on
top of head, and two tusks in the mandible, but no [other] teeth in the mouth. The tusks are thin and
apparently hollow. Length of head, 32 inches; width, 14 inches; height, 11 inches; blowhole, 5 inches.
Eyes low on head. Width of mandible [jaw] at end: Upper, 1&frac12; inches; lower, 1&frac34; inches. Width
between tusks, 3 inches. The blubber was about 2 inches thick on the head. It went ashore about
the 15th of February, 1&frac12; miles south of the life-saving station on South Beach, 2&frac12; miles south of Newport,
Oregon. The head had been severed before I arrived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A clipping from the <i>Oregonian</i> newspaper contains the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Albany, Oregon, March 2 [1904]. A peculiar specimen of the whale variety has been reported
on the Oregon coast, near Newport. J. G. Crawford, of Albany, has just returned from a trip to Newport,
where he made a picture of the head of the strange animal. The body was washed upon the beach
during the recent storm which swept the coast. It is about 15 feet long. * * * Residents of the
vicinity say they have never seen anything like it on the Oregon coast. * * * On either side of the
mouth are two villainous-looking tusks several inches in length. They are at the back of the mouth,
and extend up to a level with the top of the upper jaw. They are very wide and flat, squared on top.
The mouth has no other teeth. * * *</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>The head is equipped with a blowhole, like that of a whale. The eyes are very low, almost underneath
the lower jaws.</p>
<p>The body is in a good state of preservation, the flesh having been torn but little by the birds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On receipt of the foregoing information, letters were immediately addressed to
Mr. Crawford and also to the keeper of the life-saving station at South Beach,
Capt. Otto Wellander, asking that, if possible, the entire skeleton be preserved.
Captain Wellander replied that the whale had not been dead long when washed
ashore; that he had tried to find the body, but that the high tides had either carried
it away or buried it under driftwood.</p>
<p>The skull when cleaned passed into the possession of Mr. J. G. Crawford, who
sent to the Museum some excellent photographs of it, and also of the head before
the flesh had been removed. Later he sent the skull itself to the Museum for my
examination, and finally very generously presented it to the Museum in exchange.</p>
<p>The skull is that of an adult individual, in nearly perfect condition, with the
mandible and teeth. The parts missing are the left malar, the left tympanic bone,
the distal ends of the pterygoids and the proximal ends of the premaxill&aelig;. (<a href="#Plate_3">Pl. 3</a>,
fig. 2.)</p>
<h4>SKULL.</h4>
<p>The Oregon skull exhibits all the characters included in the original diagnosis
of the species,<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a>
but two of these, namely, the lack of a groove in front of the premaxillary
foramen, and the vertical position of the premaxill&aelig; distally, I do not
at present consider of any importance, as they are shared by <i>M. bidens</i>. The species,
as represented by the Oregon skull, however, presents other characters which clearly
differentiate it from any other species of the genius. As it is without a basirostral
groove, it allies itself in that respect to <i>M. bidens</i>, <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, and <i>hectori</i>. Unlike
those species, it has the premaxillary foramen behind the maxillary foramen, and in
this respect resembles <i>densirostris</i> and <i>grayi</i>. Perhaps the most salient characters in
which <i>stejnegeri</i> differs from <i>bidens</i> and all other known species are the erect position
and flat surface of the supraoccipital and the very prominent backward extension
of the frontal plate of the maxilla. This backward extension is so great that when
the beak is horizontal a vertical line through the posterior margin of the maxilla
passes considerably behind the temporal fossa. The only species which approaches
<i>stejnegeri</i> in this respect is <i>hectori</i>, but in the latter the supraoccipital instead of
being flat above the condyles is very strongly convex.</p>
<p>Another very marked character of <i>stejnegeri</i> is that the extension of the lateral
free margin of the orbital plate of the frontal, anterior to the orbit, is equal to the
length of the orbit itself. In <i>bidens</i> and all other known species this extension is
only from one-third to one-half the length of the orbit. Numerous other distinguishing
characters will be mentioned in the course of the following description of
<i>stejnegeri</i>, which is drawn from the adult Oregon skull, but modified when necessary
by reference to the type skull from Bering Island. Comparisons are made chiefly
with <i>M. bidens</i>, which is on the whole the best known species.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>In the Oregon skull of <i>stejnegeri</i>, the breadth between the post-orbital processes
does not exceed the length from the occipital condyles to the maxillary notches.
The skull is, therefore, narrower in proportion to its length than in any other species
of the genus except <i>hectori</i>, as represented by the skull figured by Flower. This
skull was, however, that of a young individual. It is probable that in adults of
this species the skull is broader than in <i>stejnegeri</i>.</p>
<p>In the latter species, again, the length of the brain-case, between the occipital
condyles and the maxillary notches, is just equal to the distance from the latter
point to the distal end of the maxill&aelig;, and the rostrum, including the premaxill&aelig;,
is much shorter than in other species of <i>Mesoplodon</i>, except <i>hectori</i>, as represented by
the young skull above mentioned.</p>
<p>The foramen magnum is very small, being less in width than the condyle on
either side of it. In this respect it differs widely from <i>bidens</i> and other species (as
far as can be ascertained from the figures available), except <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, in which the
relative size is about the same.</p>
<p>The supraoccipital rises vertically above each condyle to the very top of the
skull, being neither convex nor strongly bent forward as in other species, and especially
<i>bidens</i>. In the median line, however, while the occipital bone is flat immediately
above the foramen magnum, it is deeply concave higher up and without a
median ridge. The outline of the occipital crest, viewed from behind, is semicircular.
In all the foregoing characters the occipital region differs widely from that of <i>bidens</i>
and other species. The only close resemblance is found in the old skull of <i>europ&aelig;us</i>
from Long Branch, New Jersey, and even here the sides of the occipital above are
far less prominent, their outline is much more convex, the occipital crest is angular,
and the median depression is less pronounced.</p>
<p><i>Dorsal aspect</i> (<a href="#Plate_3">Pl. 3</a>, figs. 1, 2).&mdash;The most noticeable feature of the upper
surface of the skull is the large backward extension of the frontal plates of the
maxill&aelig;, the free margins of which converge strongly. The outline of the anteorbital
region is rounded. The anteorbital notch is a shallow emargination. Anterior
to this is a second still shallower emargination, the &ldquo;pseudo-notch.&rdquo; The
margin between the two is much thickened, but does not form a distinct projection
or tubercle, as in <i>bidens</i> and other species. The superior orifices of the nares are
unsymmetrical as regards position, the left being somewhat in advance of the right.
The maxill&aelig; are concave around the maxillary foramen, and external to this foramen
is an elongated ridge about as in <i>europ&aelig;us</i>. The rostral portion of the maxill&aelig; is
broad at the base but tapers more rapidly than in <i>bidens</i>. The margin is thick.
At the middle of the beak the outline of the maxill&aelig; at a lower level is visible from
above, which is not the case in <i>bidens</i> or <i>europ&aelig;us</i>. The rostral portion of the
premaxill&aelig; is oblique proximally and vertical distally. Unlike <i>bidens</i>, these edges
are sharp throughout. The mesethmoid ends opposite the maxillary foramina.
Anterior to it is seen the concave upper surface of the vomer, which, however,
becomes flat distally. At about the middle of the beak the anterior end is clasped
by the posterior forked end of a &ldquo;mesirostral&rdquo; ossification, which has a convex
surface. This ossification begins proximally below the edges of the premaxill&aelig;,
but its surface rises gradually anteriorly, and at the end of the beak it is much above
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the premaxill&aelig;. The end of the beak consists of the consolidated mass of the premaxill&aelig;
and mesirostral ossification, the whole being convex above and below, but
flat on the sides. The ossification has a deep median groove, which reaches to
within 95 mm. of the tip of the beak.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the conformation of the upper surface of the beak is quite
different from that of <i>bidens</i> or any other species.</p>
<p>The maxillary foramina are large and directed forward, and have a distinct
broad channel in front of them. In the Oregon skull the right foramen is single,
but the left divided into two. The premaxillary foramina are a little behind the
maxillary foramina. The distance between the maxillary foramina is less than
that from the median line to the anteorbital notch. In <i>bidens</i> it is much greater.</p>
<p><i>Lateral aspect</i> (<a href="#Plate_9">Pl. 9</a>, figs. 1, 2).&mdash;A most noteworthy feature of the skull when
viewed from the side is the great length between the orbit and the maxillary notch,
which far exceeds that found in <i>bidens</i> and other species, being equal to the length
of the orbit itself. The latter is about as long as the temporal fossa, which is somewhat
flattened above, as in <i>europ&aelig;us</i>. The outline of the supraoccipital is straight
and nearly vertical. The zygomatic is more massive even than <i>europ&aelig;us</i> and is
especially thick below. The inferior outline of the beak is convex proximally as in
<i>europ&aelig;us</i> and <i>layardi</i>. There is no basirostral groove, the edges of the maxill&aelig;
being very thick in front of the maxillary notch. Over the orbit the maxill&aelig; are
thick and beveled, but not raised as in <i>bowdoini</i>.</p>
<p><i>Ventral aspect</i> (<a href="#Plate_6">Pl. 6</a>, figs. 1, 2).&mdash;The beak is convex in the proximal half, much
as in <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, but farther forward is concave, except in the median line, where
there is a narrow ridge formed proximally by the vomer, which in the type skull
appears as a narrow lozenge 60 mm. long. In the adult Oregon skull it is anchylosed
with the premaxill&aelig;. The maxill&aelig; extend to within 107 mm. of the end of the beak.
The under surface of the beak is much more like that of <i>europ&aelig;us</i> than of <i>bidens</i>.</p>
<p>A narrow strip of the palatines extends around the base of the pterygoids in
front, but the two strips do not meet in the median line. In the type-skull they
do not extend inside the pterygoids. The expanded anterior end of the malar is
very long and also forms the bottom of the maxillary notch, which is the case in
<i>europ&aelig;us</i> but not in <i>bidens</i>. The inferior borders of the pterygoids are convex
anteriorly, as in <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, and are continued laterally, so that the sinus is deep as in
that species. The lachrymal is very long, the free margin having a length of 55 mm.
The posterior margin of the zygomatic process is concave, rather than convex as in
<i>bidens</i>.</p>
<p>The tympanic bulla does not differ materially from that of <i>bidens</i> in size or
shape, as far as can be judged from the figures given in Van Beneden and Gervais&rsquo;
Osteography (plate 26, figs. 4, 4<i>a</i>). The periotic is similar in size to the same bone in
<i>bidens</i>, but the posterior end is more narrowly pointed and the anterior end is
much lower, relatively. In <i>europ&aelig;us</i>, as far as can be determined from the material
at hand, the form and size of the earbone is similar to that of <i>stejnegeri</i>, but in the
latter the anterior margin of the tympanic bulla is more nearly transverse and the
posterior inferior groove is curved. (<a href="#Plate_35">Pl. 35</a>, fig. 2.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>In the Annisquam skull, supposed to represent <i>densirostris</i>, although from a
young individual, the earbone is very much larger, especially the periotic, which is
also quite differently shaped.</p>
<h4>MANDIBLE.</h4>
<p>The mandible of <i>stejnegeri</i> is much broken in the region of the angle on both
sides, but otherwise complete. As compared with a mandible of an adult <i>bidens</i>,
the most conspicuous differences are the shortness of the symphysis, the sharp
upward bend of the inferior margin anteriorly, and the large size of the alveolus.
The symphysis in the adult Oregon specimen of <i>stejnegeri</i> is 140 mm. long, or scarcely
more than in the young specimen of <i>europ&aelig;us</i> from New Jersey, and exactly the
same as in the adult type-specimen of the latter species, as figured by Van Beneden
and Gervais. The alveolus lies entirely behind the symphysis, its anterior end
being 160 mm. from the anterior end of the jaw. It is 113 mm. long and 18 mm.
wide. The mandible is 62 mm. high at its middle point. The coronoid process is
more anteriorly situated than in <i>bidens</i> and the portion of the posterior margin of
the ramus which remains indicates that the angle was strongly directed backward.
(<a href="#Plate_11">Pl. 11</a>, fig. 4; <a href="#Plate_12">pl. 12</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<h4>TEETH.</h4>
<p>The teeth are remarkable for their size and form. They are somewhat more
than twice as broad as teeth of adult males of <i>bidens</i>, as shown by the figures of
Lankester<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a>
and Grieg,<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a>
and also a little longer. They are, in fact, probably broader
than, or at least as broad as, the teeth of any other species of <i>Mesoplodon</i>, not excepting
<i>layardi</i>. Sir William Turner remarks regarding a specimen of <i>layardi</i> examined
by him that &ldquo;the breadth of the tooth, where it emerged from the alveolus, was
3&frac12; inches.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a>
He does not state, however, whether the measurement was taken
along the top of the alveolus, at an angle with the transverse axis of the tooth, or
along the transverse axis itself. At all events, the teeth figured by Owen and
others are much less than 3&frac12; inches broad. The teeth of adult <i>europ&aelig;us</i> are only
2 inches broad, and of <i>bidens</i>, as already stated, 1&frac12; inches broad.</p>
<p>In <i>stejnegeri</i> (<a href="#Plate_12">Pl. 12</a>, figs. 1-3) the portion of the tooth above the alveolus is
inclined slightly inward and backward, but the pointed tip curves outward so as
to be vertical. When extracted from the alveolus, the whole tooth is found to be
concave internally and convex externally. The posterior margin is convex and the
anterior sinuous, a slight convexity occurring on the portion which projects above
the alveolus. In this place the outer coating of cement is broken through, showing
the underlying dentine or osteo-dentine, which is somewhat corroded or absorbed.
This is particularly noticeable on the left tooth.</p>
<p>The upper margin of the tooth is transverse, or nearly at right angles with the
anterior and posterior margins. The posterior angle is rounded and the anterior
raised into an acute point by the projection of the dentine as a distinct, sharp cusp.
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
The inferior end of the tooth is cut off obliquely and the margin is broken by numerous
prominent rugosities. The surface of all that part of the tooth which is contained
in the alveolus and covered by the gum above it is rugose, while the part
above the gum is quite smooth and highly polished.</p>
<p>The right tooth has the following dimensions (in straight lines): Length of
anterior border, 150 mm.; length of posterior border, 107; length of superior border,
54; length of inferior border, 86; average length of exposed dentine tip, 10; greatest
breadth of tooth, antero-posteriorly, 81; greatest breadth of tooth, transversely,
15; distance from center of base of exposed portion, when in position in the
alveolus, to tip of dentine projection, 82; distance from center of base of portion
above the gum to tip of dentine projection, 70; distance from center of base
of portion above the gum to center of inferior margin, 76.</p>

<h4>EXTERNAL FORM.</h4>
<p>The photograph of the head (<a href="#Plate_40">Pl. 40</a>, fig. 4) shows that the end of the beak was
quite blunt, and the lower jaw quite a little longer than the upper. The superior
margin of the lower jaw, which is concave in front of the tooth, is strongly convex
and elevated at the side of it and behind it. The inferior margin of the upper jaw
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
is straight anteriorly, but farther back appears to be pressed upward by the tooth.
An examination of the skull shows that the mandible can be lowered so that the
teeth are below the upper jaw, but when so lowered the space between the teeth
and the upper jaw on each side is barely a quarter of an inch (6 mm.). With the
integuments in place, it is doubtful whether the mouth could be opened any wider
than is shown in the photograph. The convexity of the head, shape of the blowhole,
position of the eye, etc., do not appear to differ materially from the same
characters in adults of <i>M. bidens</i>.</p>

<p>It has not seemed to me necessary in the present connection to attempt to cite
all the multitudinous names which have been given to this species, especially as
those zoologists most competent to judge, including Van Beneden, Flower, and
Turner, after detailed consideration, have concluded that but one species of <i>Ziphius</i>,
or at most two species, exist at present.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>
<p>Nearly all the skulls in European museums are assigned by the zoologists mentioned
to <i>Z. cavirostris</i> proper, but some doubt has been entertained regarding two
or three European skulls, and one specimen from Argentina, described by Burmeister.
These last-mentioned specimens have been thought to possibly represent
a second species, <i>Z. gervaisii</i>. The principal characters of the latter are the narrow,
flat premaxill&aelig;, the lack of a prominent mesirostral ossification, and small teeth.
From the large series of skulls in the National Museum, I am able to dispose of the
doubt concerning <i>Z. gervaisii</i>. I find that wherever the characters above mentioned
occur the sex (when known) is female. There is every reason, therefore, to
believe that <i>Z. gervaisii</i> is the female of <i>Z. cavirostris</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a>
I will return to this point again later.</p>
<p>In 1865 Cope described a species from Charleston, South Carolina, under the
name of <i>Hypero&ouml;don semijunctus</i>. In 1886 I referred it to the genus <i>Ziphius</i>, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
was in doubt as to its specific identity. I thought that it might represent <i>Z. gervaisii</i>,
which is interesting in the present connection because the type-specimen was
a female.</p>
<p>In 1883 Dr. L. Stejneger described a species which he had discovered on Bering
Island, Bering Sea, under the name of <i>Z. grebnitzkii</i>. Through the instrumentality
of Doctor Stejneger and Governor Grebnitzki, the National Museum later received
a large series of skulls from the same locality. The question of whether this species
is identical with <i>Z. cavirostris</i>, or distinct, has caused me much study, and forms
the principal subject of this chapter.</p>
<p>The National Museum has at present the following material, which may be
considered as certainly representing <i>Z. cavirostris</i>:</p>
<p>1. A complete skeleton and cast of an adult female, 19 feet 4 inches long,
obtained at Barnegat City, New Jersey, October 3, 1883. Cat. No. 20971.</p>
<p>2. A complete skeleton and photographs of an adult male, 20 feet 1 inch long,
obtained at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1901, through Dr. E. A. Mearns, Mr. L. di Z.
Mearns, and Capt. Gus Soderman. Cat. No. 49599.</p>
<p>3. The collection contains also the skeleton of the young female individual
obtained at Charleston, South Carolina, prior to 1865, which constitutes the type of
<i>Hypero&ouml;don semijunctus</i> Cope. It was originally in the Charleston College Museum,
but later was received by the National Museum in exchange. This individual was
between 12 and 13 feet long. Cat. No. 21975.</p>
<p>In addition, the national collections contain the following material, known to,
or supposed to, represent the species <i>Z. grebnitzkii</i>:</p>
<p>4. Cat. No. 20993. Skull of a male (?).<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a>
Collected by Dr. L. Stejneger in Bering Island, 1882. Orig. No. 1521. Type of <i>Ziphius grebnitzkii</i>.</p>
<p>5. Cat. No. 21245. Skull. Orig. No. 1758.</p>
<p>6. Cat. No. 21246. Skull. Orig. No. 2531.</p>

<p>8. Cat. No. 21248. Skull of a male (?).</p>
<p>9. Cat. No. 83991. Skull.</p>
<p>The five skulls preceding were also collected by Doctor Stejneger in Bering Island in 1882 and 1883.</p>
<p>10. Cat. No. 22069. Skull of a female (?).<a class="fn" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>11. Cat. No. 22874. Skull.</p>
<p>12. Cat. No. 22875. Bones of an immature individual.</p>
<p>These three specimens were collected and presented by N. Grebnitzki.</p>
<p>13. Cat. No. 142579. A series of photographs of an individual captured in
Kiska Harbor, Alaska, September, 1904. Presented by Dr. J. Hobart Egbert.</p>
<p>14. Cat. No. 84906. Photograph of the skeleton of an individual washed ashore
at St. Simon Island, Georgia, in 1893, and belonging to Mr. W. Arnold.</p>
<p>In the genus <i>Ziphius</i>, as in other ziphioid genera, a study of the characters of the
skull appears to afford the best basis for discrimination of species. We have first to
consider whether the North American species is the same as the European and New
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Zealand species, and afterwards whether the North Pacific species is identical with
or distinct from these.</p>
<p>The published measurements of specimens from the coasts of Europe and New
Zealand, currently believed to represent the single species <i>Z. cavirostris</i>, are rather
meager, and, furthermore, prove, on examination, to present so little uniformity
that they are of limited use for comparison with measurements of skulls from the
Atlantic coast of the United States. About all that can be said is that the latter
skulls are of about the same size as the former and that the proportions do not present
any striking differences. For detailed measurements of the American skulls,
see <a href="#Page_53">page 53</a>.</p>
<p>On account of the uncertainty as regards the measurements, I have had recourse
to the published descriptions and figures, especially those of Van Beneden, Sir
William Turner, and Doctor Haast. So far as I can perceive, there is nothing in
these descriptions that is not applicable to the skulls Nos. 49599 and 20971, from
Newport, Rhode Island, and Barnegat City, New Jersey, respectively, in the National
Museum, and I can find no reason for regarding the latter other than as representatives
of <i>Z. cavirostris</i>.</p>
<h4>HISTORY OF THE NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND, SPECIMEN.</h4>
<p>Of the Newport specimen, No. 49599, the Museum has the complete skeleton,
together with external measurements and a photograph. From data at hand it
appears that the animal was originally obtained in Narragansett Bay about October
30, 1901, and afterwards towed to Fort Adams, near Newport. A few days later it
was sent adrift again and stranded in the harbor of Dutch Island, near Canonicut
Island, which is opposite Newport. While at Fort Adams its existence was made
known to the Museum by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, and his son, Louis Mearns;
and a preparator was sent to obtain the skeleton. With the aid of Captain Soderman,
of the government tug <i>Monroe</i>, he found it at Dutch Island, and reported that
it was a male, 20 feet 1 inch in length, measured along the curves of the back (18
feet 6 inches in a straight line). The epidermis was nearly all lacking, but the back
appeared to have been black. The length in a straight line, as reported by Mr. Louis
Mearns, was 19 feet. The complete measurements taken by the preparator, Mr. J.
W. Scollick, are as follows:</p>

<p>The photograph, which is reproduced in <a href="#Plate_41">Pl. 41</a>, fig. 4, gives a good idea of
the general form of the animal.</p>
<h4>HISTORY OF THE BARNEGAT CITY, NEW JERSEY, SPECIMEN.</h4>
<p>Of the Barnegat City specimen, No. 20971, the Museum has the complete
skeleton, together with a cast of one-half of the entire animal, and another of the
head, and some measurements, all of which were obtained by Mr. William Palmer
and myself October 3, 1883. The Museum received notice of the stranding of this
specimen from Capt. J. H. Ridgway, of the United States life-saving station at
Barnegat City. It was an adult female, 19 feet 4 inches long in a straight line.
The complete measurements, taken in straight lines with a rod and cord, are as
follows:</p>

<p>I neglected to make a full description of the color, but noted that it was stone
gray, lighter above and darker below; snout nearly white. The cast, which was
painted from a sketch made at Barnegat City and from pieces of skin brought to
Washington, bears out this note in general, but with modifications. The color
of the body as a whole is gray tinged with dull yellowish. The gray is darker on
the back than on the belly, but on the latter is a large area of dark brown, reaching
from near the pectoral fins to and beyond the anus, and halfway up on the sides.
On this dark area are several large oval whitish blotches, some two inches in
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
diameter. Both upper and lower jaws nearly to the angle of the mouth are cream
white. On the sides and belly the gray color is speckled with black spots of about
the size of a grain of wheat. The pectoral fins are dark gray above and below;
the flukes were similarly colored.</p>

<p>The close correspondence in proportions shown in this table favors the idea
of specific identity, and taken with the similarity in size, and characters of the
skull, warrants, I think, the assumption that the specimens from the Atlantic
coast of the United States belong to <i>Z. cavirostris</i>.</p>
<h4>COLORATION.</h4>
<p>It should be remarked, however, that the Barnegat City specimen does not
agree in color with any of the European or New Zealand specimens. On the other
hand, the latter show a most extraordinary diversity in color, some being black,
with the head and back as far as the dorsal fin white; others all black above, white
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
below, and the head black and brown. The color of the young specimen from
Buenos Ayres, Argentina, is described by Burmeister as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the body of the animal is of a light gray color, a little yellowish, resembling the color of light
ash, but much darker on the back and much lighter on the belly. The fins are much darker than the
back&mdash;almost black&mdash;and the large fin of the tail has a very pure white area of irregular shape on the
underside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the indications from the skull and proportions are trustworthy <i>Z. cavirostris</i>
must be a species in which the color is very variable, differing perhaps in the two
sexes, or with differences in age. This is, however, by no means certain at present,
and whether the diversities of color reported in different specimens are merely
individual variations, or are due to post-mortem changes, remains to be discovered.
It will be noticed that the color of the Argentine specimen is nearest to
that of the Barnegat City specimen.</p>
<h4>TYPE OF ZIPHIUS SEMIJUNCTUS (COPE).</h4>
<p>The type-specimen of <i>Ziphius semijunctus</i> (Cope), as already mentioned, is a young
female.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a>
The most noticeable characters which it presents are that the
premaxill&aelig; are flat proximally, and that the teeth are small, sharp-pointed and
open at the roots. The form of the teeth is undoubtedly due to immaturity, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
as the shape of the premaxill&aelig; is similar to that found in the nominal species <i>gervaisii</i>,
it might be thought necessary to refer <i>semijunctus</i> to the latter species. As
will be shown later, however, this form of the premaxill&aelig; appears to be characteristic
of the adult female of <i>cavirostris</i>, and of immature individuals of either
sex, the young, as in many kinds of animals, resembling the adult female rather
than the male.</p>
<p>I have been able to find but one character in the skull of <i>semijunctus</i> which might
be regarded as specific. This is that the lachrymal bone is thick distally, and cut
off square at the end. In other specimens of <i>Ziphius</i> examined it is thin and flat,
and rounded or pointed at the end. As there is much individual variation in the form
of the lachrymal, this peculiarity alone is, in my opinion, an insufficient indication
of the validity of the species.</p>
<h4>COMPARISON OF SKELETONS.</h4>
<p>A comparison of the skeletons of the three individuals from the Atlantic coast
of the United States reveals a number of differences of more or less importance.
Were it not for the lack of reliable differences in the skulls, it might be considered
that these variations in other parts of the skeletons indicated specific difference.
I am disposed, however, since the Barnegat and Newport specimens are of opposite
sexes, to regard them partly as sexual and partly as individual. In the case of the
Charleston specimen (<i>semijunctus</i>), the skeleton, besides being immature, has been
very much damaged by careless handling, and nearly all the bones are somewhat
abraded. It is, therefore, only available to a limited extent for purposes of comparison.
As no description of a <i>Ziphius</i> skeleton from the coast of the United States
has, so far as I am aware, been published hitherto, and as descriptions of skeletons of
Old World specimens are few and rather brief, I shall give below a detailed comparative
description of the American specimens. For the sake of brevity, I shall refer
to each specimen merely by the locality.</p>
<h4>VERTEBRAL COLUMN AS A WHOLE.</h4>
<p>The vertebral formula in the three North American specimens and in four Old
World specimens and Burmeister&rsquo;s Argentine specimen is as follows:</p>

<p>In the figures of the Argentine specimen the last ten caudals are practically
without characters, and it is perhaps allowable to question whether the terminal
two or three were not added to make an even taper to the end of the column. If
such be not the case, this specimen had more vertebr&aelig; than any other.</p>
<h4>CHARACTERS OF THE VERTEBR&AElig;.</h4>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;The seventh cervical vertebra presents a conical metapophysis,
which on the first thoracic vertebra forms of a rather thick, long, declining process
ending in a facet for the tubercle of the first rib. This metapophysis maintains
nearly the same form as far as the sixth thoracic vertebra, but on the third thoracic
a mammiliform process makes its appearance on the anterior margin near the tip,
and becomes more prominent on each succeeding vertebra. On the seventh thoracic
it becomes larger, thin, and upright, and widely separated from the articular facet
for the tubercle of the rib. On the centrum of this vertebra lower down is a second
much larger rugose articular facet. On the eighth thoracic vertebra the upper
articular process disappears altogether and is replaced by a transverse process on a
lower level, with a facet at the free end for the rib. On the ninth thoracic the transverse
processes are larger and nearly straight. They are longer on the first lumbar
and incline a little forward. Those of the succeeding vertebr&aelig; are similar, but
decrease gradually in length, while somewhat increasing in breadth. They are last
traceable on the ninth caudal. On the eighth caudal they are perforated by a
foramen.</p>
<p>All the vertebr&aelig; from the first cervical backward have neural spines as far as
and including the eleventh caudal. The spine on the first thoracic is rather short,
narrow and pointed. These spines increase in height in succeeding vertebr&aelig; as far
as the sixth lumbar; at the same time the breadth increases antero-posteriorly and
the tip becomes expanded. The spines are nearly equally high on all the succeeding
lumbars, but begin to decrease on the caudals and disappear altogether on the
eleventh caudal.</p>
<p>The anterior zygapophyses and metapophyses maintain a nearly constant
position close to the top of the centra throughout the column, from the seventh
thoracic backward, and are vertical, thin, and oblong, squared or rounded. They
begin to decrease in size noticeably on the first caudal, and on the seventh caudal
are mere swellings at the sides of the nearly horizontal plate from which the neural
spine springs. They are traceable as far as the twelfth caudal.</p>
<p>A ridge appears on the side of the neural arch near its base on the fifth caudal
and is stronger and very marked on those following, to the ninth caudal. A ridge
unites the anterior and posterior facets for the chevrons on the ninth and succeeding
caudals.</p>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;Unlike the Newport skeleton, there are no neural
spines on the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervicals. The spine on the first thoracic
vertebra is quite short and sharp, and on the second, third, and fourth thoracics also
is rather pointed, though of increased length. There is no metapophysis on the
seventh cervical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>On the seventh thoracic the facet for the tubercle of the rib, instead of being
very prominent, becomes inconspicuous. The metapophysis is flat and squared,
and there is no lower facet on the side of the centrum. On the eighth thoracic the
metapophysis is thin, squared, and vertical, and a well-formed transverse process
appears on the side of the centrum. The transverse processes of the ninth thoracic
are a little curved backward, and on the first lumbar and succeeding vertebr&aelig; bent
forward. These processes are less tapering on all the lumbars than in the Newport
skeleton. They disappear on the eighth caudal. None is perforated.</p>
<p>The longest neural spine is on the sixth lumbar, and on all the lumbars both
the anterior and posterior edges are somewhat convex. Hence their shape is rather
different from those of the Newport skeleton, in which the anterior margins are
somewhat concave. The tips of the spines are rather suddenly expanded. The
spines of the caudals are rather more expanded at the tip and more inclined backward
than in the Newport skeleton. They disappear on the eleventh caudal.</p>
<p>The horizontal plate joining the metapophyses is noticeable on the fifth caudal.
The ridge on the side of the neural arch is first noticeable on the fourth caudal and
is very strong on the fifth, sixth, and seventh. The metapophyses are last traceable
on the twelfth caudal.</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;This skeleton resembles the Newport one as regards
the facets for the articulation of the tubercles of the ribs, except that the seventh
thoracic resembles the sixth and has no lower facet on the side of the centrum. The
transverse processes of the ninth thoracic are rather strongly curved backward,
while those on the last thoracic and first lumbar are nearly straight. On succeeding
vertebr&aelig; they are inclined forward. They are last traceable on the eighth or
ninth caudal (vertebra 35 or 36). None is perforated by a foramen.</p>
<p>Though the vertebr&aelig; are defective, there appear to have been no neural spines
on the fourth to the seventh cervicals, inclusive. The spine on the first thoracic is
short, and on the first to the fourth is pointed. The spine disappears on the tenth
caudal (vertebra 37).</p>
<p>The metapophyses assume the vertical position on the eighth thoracic. The
last of these processes is barely traceable on the tenth caudal (vertebra 37). The
ridge on the side of the neural arch is well marked on the fifth to the ninth caudals,
inclusive. On the seventh caudal (vertebra 34) the anterior and posterior facets
for the chevrons are united on the right side, and on the eighth caudal and succeeding
vertebr&aelig; on both sides.</p>
<h4>CERVICAL VERTEBR&AElig;.</h4>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;The first four cervicals are united. The foramen
above the anterior articular facets of the atlas is complete, and the edges of these
facets are raised. The inferior lateral process is flat, broad, and strongly bent
backward.</p>
<p>Second cervical: Inferior lateral process nearly as long as that of the first
cervical; broad, flat, and bent backward parallel with the process of the first cervical.
Superior lateral process short, strong, and flat. A large incomplete foramen between
it and the inferior process.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Third cervical: A short, conical inferior process, curved forward.</p>
<p>Fourth cervical: Similar, but with smaller and shorter inferior process. Neural
arch and spine complete; the latter fused with the preceding spines. Arch not
reducing the size of the neural canal.</p>
<p>Fifth cervical: Arch and spine broken. Arch nearly as broad as the anterior
epiphysis of the centrum. Inferior lateral process short, straight, and directed
obliquely outward.</p>
<p>Sixth cervical: Spine broken. Arch complete, nearly as wide as the anterior
epiphysis. Inferior lateral process short, thick, knobbed, and directed obliquely
outward and a very little forward. The left longer.</p>
<p>Seventh cervical: Spine obsolete. Arch complete, as wide as the anterior
epiphysis. No superior lateral process or metapophysis. A thick articular facet
for the head of the first rib on the middle of the side of the centrum. No inferior
lateral process.</p>
<p>Fused spines of the first to fourth cervicals bent backward; the mass broad
antero-posteriorly and rounded at the tip.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;First cervical with the foramen over the anterior articular
facets incomplete, and the borders of the facets less raised. The facets also broader
and more declined. Inferior lateral process thicker, somewhat tapering, and nearly
transverse.</p>
<p>Second cervical: Inferior lateral process much shorter than that of first cervical,
about parallel with it, but with the tip bent forward. Superior lateral process short,
thick, and bent backward; joined to the inferior process on the right side, inclosing
an oval foramen.</p>
<p>Third cervical: A short, straight, triangular superior process on the right side;
that on the left short and blunt. Inferior lateral process long, thick, club-shaped,
and curved backward.</p>
<p>Fourth cervical: Inferior lateral process similar to the last in shape, but shorter,
broad and flat, and only slightly curved backward. Neural arch and spine separate
from those of the third cervical; the arch rather smaller than those preceding it,
and reducing the size of the neural canal.</p>
<p>Fused spines of the first to third cervicals nearly vertical, rather high, and
obtusely pointed.</p>
<p>Fifth cervical: Spine pointed and quite long. Arch complete. Inferior lateral
process short, squared, flattened, and directed outward obliquely.</p>
<p>Sixth cervical: Spine about as long as on the fifth cervical. Arch much narrower
than the anterior epiphysis. Inferior lateral process prominent, thick,
somewhat compressed, and directed downward.</p>
<p>Seventh cervical: Spine as high as the arch, obtusely pointed. Arch complete,
as wide as the anterior epiphysis. A strong conical superior lateral process, or
metapophysis, on a broad base, directed forward. An articular raised facet on
the side of the centrum, directed obliquely backward. No inferior lateral process.</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;The first to fourth cervicals resemble those of the
Newport skeleton, but the fourth entirely separate. All the lateral processes
undeveloped, or broken off, except the right inferior lateral process of the atlas,
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
which is like that of the Newport specimen. The anterior foramen of the atlas is
incomplete, as in that specimen, and the spines of the conjoined vertebr&aelig; are
vertical and pointed. (<a href="#Plate_25">Pl. 25</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<p>Fifth cervical: Spine wanting. Arch complete. Inferior lateral process undeveloped,
or abraded.</p>
<p>Sixth cervical: Spine and processes broken. Arch wide.</p>
<p>Seventh cervical: Similar to that of the Newport skeleton, but the spine
obsolete or broken.</p>
<h4>THORACIC VERTEBR&AElig;.</h4>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;First thoracic: Spine vertical, pointed, about as high
as arch and centrum together. A moderately long process with articular facet
for tubercle of rib on side of neural arch; facet elliptical and directed a little downward
and forward. A smaller facet for head of second rib on posterior upper edge
of centrum.</p>
<p>Seventh thoracic: Metapophyses long, extending horizontally, straight superiorly.
A small articular facet on the outer side near the base, directed downward;
strongest on right side. A very small facet on posterior upper edge of centrum,
scarcely noticeable on right side. Neural spine rather narrow at tip; superior
margin straight.</p>
<p>Eighth thoracic: Metapophyses squared and thin. A distinct transverse
process on side of centrum about half as broad as the centrum is long, and as long
as centrum is broad; flattened, squared, and a little curved backward and upward.
Articular facet for rib elliptical and directed obliquely backward. A broad, shallow
groove across base of transverse process, the anterior edge of which is emarginate
proximally. Neural spine as in seventh thoracic.</p>
<p>Ninth thoracic: Metapophyses squared. Transverse process similar to that
of eighth thoracic, but equal to centrum in length, little narrowed at base, and
directed outward; anterior edge convex, posterior concave; articular facet occupying
the posterior half of the distal edge. A very shallow groove proximally.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;First thoracic: Neural spine a little curved backward and
rounded at tip; much higher than length of arch and centrum together. Articular
facets as in Barnegat skeleton.</p>
<p>Seventh thoracic: Metapophyses similar in shape to those of Barnegat skeleton
but with a very distinct facet on side of arch, terminating a process about as long
as the greatest diameter of the facet; surface of facet rugose. Below this process,
on side of centrum, a very large, oval, sessile facet, reaching forward nearly to the
anterior face of the centrum and upward to its superior edge. A very low, small
swelling on the posterior superior edge of centrum, probably indicating the point
of attachment of a cartilage connecting the head of the eighth rib. Neural spine
expanded at free end, and superior margin rounded.</p>
<p>Eighth thoracic: Metapophyses similar to those of Barnegat skeleton. A
distinct transverse process nearly as broad as the length of the centrum, oblong or
squared, flat, directed somewhat backward, but not upward. Articular facet for
rib not occupying whole of free end and only slightly directed backward; anterior
margin as in Barnegat skeleton. Neural spine similar to that of seventh thoracic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Ninth thoracic: Similar to that of Barnegat skeleton, but transverse process
longer than centrum and directed a little downward, articular facet occupying less
than posterior half of free margin; proximal groove inconspicuous; anterior and
posterior margins nearly straight.</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;The centra of the thoracic, as well as the lumbar,
vertebr&aelig; in this individual present inferior median keels, and more or less concave
sides, which is not the case in the Barnegat and Newport skeletons. This can not
be due to immaturity, as in a still younger individual, supposed to represent <i>Ziphius
grebnitzkii</i>, the thoracic vertebr&aelig; are rounded below. The neural spines of the
thoracic vertebr&aelig; are much less inclined backward in <i>semijunctus</i> than in the Newport
and Barnegat skeletons, but this is doubtless connected with age, as the younger
series of vertebr&aelig; already mentioned exhibits the peculiarity in a more marked
degree. A similar modification dependent upon age appears to affect <i>Hyper&ouml;odon</i>,
as will be seen by comparing Van Beneden and Gervais&rsquo; figures in the Osteography,
plate 18.</p>
<p>First thoracic: Similar to that of Newport skeleton, but spine not higher than
arch alone. (A little abraded at tip, but probably undeveloped.)</p>
<p>Seventh thoracic: Metapophyses short (abraded), incompletely developed. A
distinct facet on side of same on an elongated process, as in Newport skeleton, but
no second larger one on side of centrum. No facet on superior margin of centrum
either anteriorly or posteriorly.</p>
<p>Eighth thoracic: Transverse process similar to that of Barnegat skeleton, but
anterior edge nearly straight; process about one-half as broad as length of centrum.
(Indications of immaturity.)</p>
<h4>LUMBAR VERTEBR&AElig;.</h4>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;First lumbar: Similar to last thoracic, but transverse
process expanded distally and slightly directed forward; a little longer than centrum;
anterior and posterior edges emarginate proximally.</p>
<p>Eleventh lumbar (last): Centrum very long. Neural arch and spine very high,
more than twice length of centrum. Spine inclined backward much beyond posterior
face of centrum; anterior margin straight, posterior convex, tip expanded.
Transverse process a little more than one-half length of centrum, somewhat expanded
at distal end and curved forward so that tip is about in line with anterior face of
centrum. Metapophyses close to centrum and to each other, semihexagonal in outline.
A sharp median inferior ridge, and shallow posterior oblique channels on
under side of centrum.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;First lumbar: Similar to that of Barnegat skeleton, but
transverse processes considerably longer than the centrum and not expanded at tip;
anterior edge straight, posterior only slightly emarginate proximally.</p>
<p>Tenth lumbar (last): Centrum like that in Barnegat skeleton. Neural arch
and spine only slightly higher than length of centrum. Transverse process oblong,
free margin nearly transverse; process inclined forward so that tip is a little beyond
anterior face of centrum. Metapophyses close to centrum, rounded in outline.
Neural spine much inclined backward; anterior edge concave, posterior convex,
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
tip expanded. A rounded inferior median ridge and very distinct oblique posterior
channels on under side of centrum.</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;First lumbar: Similar to that of Barnegat skeleton,
but transverse process directed outward and scarcely or not at all forward; length
of process equal to that of centrum; tip rounded (due to immaturity).</p>
<p>Tenth lumbar (last): Centrum very long. Neural arch and spine a little less
in height than length of centrum. Transverse process oblong, curved forward, more
than one-half as long as centrum. Metapophyses similar to those of Newport skeleton.
Inferior median ridge very sharp; lateral channels rather indistinct.</p>
<h4>CAUDAL VERTEBR&AElig;.</h4>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;First caudal (vert. 28): Similar to last lumbar, but
neural spine broader antero-posteriorly. Transverse process &#2154; length of centrum,
inversely triangular, the tip much in advance of anterior face of centrum, free end
somewhat rounded. Metapophyses similar to those of last lumbar. No median
inferior ridge, but two short processes bearing facets for chevrons posteriorly and a
very slight indication of similar process anteriorly, but without facets. Posterior
inferior oblique channels indistinct.</p>
<p>Seventh caudal (vert. 34): Centrum (exclusive of chevron processes) nearly as
deep as long. Neural arch and spine only a little higher than length of centrum,
very much inclined backward and expanded at distal end; free border of spine
straight. Metapophyses close to centrum, united nearly to tips by a horizontal
plate. A ridge extends backward from their tips nearly across the arch. Another
very prominent ridge traverses the centrum at the base of the arch. At the posterior
end, a deep groove, convex forward, extends down the side of the centrum, making
an emargination in the transverse process and proceeding thence down the lower
side of centrum to its lower middle point, where it ends in a deep semicircular emargination
between the anterior and posterior chevron facets. Transverse process a
triangular stub, reaching nearly to the line of the anterior face of centrum. Chevron
processes very large, and the median inferior surface of the centrum between them
deeply grooved longitudinally.</p>
<p>Tenth caudal (vert. 37): Centrum as deep as long. Neural spine a low ridge, as
long as the centrum, and extending beyond it posteriorly. No transverse processes.
A foramen in side of centrum much above the middle and a similar one below. Close
to the latter and below it another foramen pierces the ridge uniting the chevron
processes, and appears below on side of longitudinal inferior median channel.
Metapophyses small mammilliform processes on top of centrum.</p>
<p>Eleventh caudal (vert. 38): No processes. A very small neural spine. Posterior
epiphysis strongly convex.</p>
<p>Twelfth caudal (vert. 39): A rounded mass without processes.</p>
<p>Thirteenth caudal (vert. 40): An oblong mass, with two grooves on each side,
two widely separate foramina above and two closely approximated below, entering
a common depression, with rounded projections on its borders.</p>
<p>Fourteenth caudal (vert. 41): Similar to thirteenth caudal, but with a single
lateral groove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Fifteenth caudal (vert. 42): Similar to fourteenth caudal, but sides extending
upward and downward in a ridge. Inferior foramina nearly as far apart as
superior and posterior epiphysis much smaller than anterior.</p>
<p>Sixteenth caudal (vert. 43): Similar to fifteenth caudal, but the disproportion
of epiphyses greater and lateral ridges higher. Superior and inferior surfaces of
centrum inclined.</p>
<p>Seventeenth caudal (vert. 44): Similar to preceding, but smaller.</p>
<p>Eighteenth caudal (vert. 45): Longer than high. Inferior ridge longer and
larger than superior. Groove very large. Anterior face of centrum deeply concave,
posterior flat. Posterior epiphysis very much smaller than anterior. Foramina
very small, practically obliterated on right side.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;First caudal (vert. 27): Similar to last lumbar, but transverse
process shorter, about two-thirds as long as centrum, oblong and but little
constricted at base; distal margin nearly straight. The process does not extend
forward quite to the line of the anterior face of centrum. No inferior median ridge,
but strong posterior chevron processes. Postero-inferior oblique grooves very
distinct.</p>
<p>Seventh caudal (vert. 33): Similar to the same vertebra in Barnegat skeleton,
but neural spine more inclined backward and anterior border deeply concave.
Metapophyses oblong, directed upward, not reaching anterior face of centrum as
they do in Barnegat skeleton. Anterior face of centrum receding superiorly and the
ridge opposite it on side of centrum shorter than in Barnegat skeleton. Ridge
behind metapophyses indistinct. Postero-inferior oblique grooves as in Barnegat
skeleton, but piercing transverse process, forming a foramen. Anterior and posterior
chevron processes very large and receding very much, as do also the anterior and
posterior faces of centrums.</p>
<p>Eleventh caudal (vert. 37): Similar to Barnegat skeleton, but spine shorter
than centrum and not extending beyond it anteriorly or posteriorly. Metapophyses
similar, but wider apart.</p>
<p>Twelfth caudal (vert. 38): Neural arch barely complete. No spine.</p>
<p>Thirteenth to nineteenth caudals (vert. 39-45): Similar to those of Barnegat
skeleton.</p>
<p>Twentieth caudal (vert. 46): Rudely triangular, with a peg-like posterior projection,
bearing the very small posterior epiphysis. No foramina. Anterior epiphysis
deeply concave in middle.</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;First caudal (vert. 28): Similar to last lumbar, but
only a faint inferior median ridge. Inferior outline of centrum antero-posteriorly
very concave, which is not the case in the Barnegat and Newport skeletons. Posterior
chevron processes prominent. Postero-inferior oblique grooves shallow.</p>
<p>Seventh caudal (vert. 34): Like the Newport skeleton. The transverse process
not pierced or emarginate. Postero-inferior oblique grooves indistinct. Ridges on
centrum very distinct. Right anterior and posterior chevron processes united and
pierced by a foramen.</p>
<p>Tenth caudal (vert. 37): Similar to the same vertebra in Newport skeleton, but
neural spine very short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<h4>CHEVRONS.</h4>
<p>The number of chevrons in the North American and some other specimens is
as follows:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td>Newport, Rhode Island.</td><td class="r">11</td></tr>
<tr><td>Barnegat City, New Jersey.</td><td class="r">8(+3?)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Charleston, South Carolina.</td><td class="r">8+</td></tr>
<tr><td>Buenos Ayres, Argentina (Burmeister).</td><td class="r">11</td></tr>
<tr><td>Holma, Sweden (Malm).</td><td class="r">9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Littleton Harbor, New Zealand (Haast).</td><td class="r">10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Warrington, New Zealand (Scott and Parker).</td><td class="r">9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pisa Museum (Van Beneden).</td><td class="r">9</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The chevrons are similar in form in the three North American specimens,
with some differences which will be pointed out below.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;The first chevron consists of a pair of bones which are not
united. They are longer than deep, their depth indeed being less than that of
any one of the succeeding bones except the tenth and eleventh. Each presents
one strong superior articulating facet. Second chevron, elongated antero-posteriorly,
but not much deeper than the first. Third chevron very deep and
only equaled in that respect by the fourth; narrowed and rounded off below. Fourth
chevron largest and broadest (antero-posteriorly) of the series; expanded below
and the lower border transverse. Fifth to eighth similar in form, but less deep
successively, and the lower border more rounded. Ninth similar to eighth, but
smaller and thinner. Tenth similar to first, longer (antero-posteriorly) than deep.
Eleventh similar to tenth in form, but smaller.</p>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;First chevron bone lacking. Second like that of
Newport skeleton, but smaller. Third similar to second, but much larger and
more produced posteriorly; quite unlike the third in the Newport skeleton in form,
and much less deep. Fourth, largest and deepest of the series; anterior and posterior
borders rounded, and the inferior border similar. Fifth to eighth similar in
form, but successively less deep, and all more expanded below; inferior border
nearly straight. Ninth similar to eighth, but depth not exceeding breadth; lower
angles produced.</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;The chevrons of this specimen resemble those of the
Newport skeleton, but on account of immaturity they are all more or less rounded.
The two sides of the first chevron are united. The second is without the posterior
angular projection seen in the other specimens. The third is the deepest of the
series. The eighth is not deeper than long, and hence resembles the tenth chevron
of the Newport skeleton in proportion, but is, of course, much smaller. Two or
three chevrons are lacking from the posterior end of the series.</p>
<h4>RIBS.</h4>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;First rib shortest and broadest, but considerably
broader at proximal end than at distal end. Head and tubercle close together.
The succeeding ribs increase in length and decrease in breadth to the fifth or sixth.
The third, fourth, and fifth are expanded and flattened at distal end. Seventh,
eighth, and ninth successively shorter. Distance between head and tubercle
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
greater on second rib than on first, and on third is greater than on second. On
the third to sixth, inclusive, the distance is about equal. The tubercle is scarcely
distinguishable on the seventh rib, while on the eighth and ninth it is lacking,
these ribs joining the transverse processes by a terminal facet only.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;Similar to those of the Barnegat skeleton, but first rib
maintains nearly the same breadth throughout. Neck thicker than in Barnegat
skeleton. Seventh rib terminates proximally in a single large rugose facet, which
connects with a similar facet on side of centrum of seventh thoracic vertebra.</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;Similar to those of the Barnegat skeleton, but a
distinct tubercle on the seventh rib. Eighth and ninth ribs end proximally in a
transverse facet only, which is largest on the eighth. Tenth rib (represented by
a fragment) only half as broad as the preceding ones and more nearly round in
section.</p>
<h4>STERNUM.</h4>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;Five segments. Manubrium wider than long, convex
inferiorly. Deep anterior and posterior notches, about equal, the former with
an angular projection on each side. Facet for cartilaginous sternal rib thick and
prominent. Second segment wider than long, about equally notched anteriorly
and posteriorly, the two sides anchylosed together by a bony bridge, about as wide
as the notches are deep. Third and fourth segments similar to second but smaller;
similarly notched; left portion a little longer than right. Fifth segment elongated,
left side very much so; the two sides joined by a narrow bridge; posterior notch
very deep.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;Similar to sternum of Barnegat skeleton, but manubrium
scarcely wider than long; posterior notch much longer than anterior, with parallel
sides. Second and third segments similar to those of Barnegat skeleton but sides
of latter not completely anchylosed together. Fourth segment in two pieces, with
a wide interval between. Fifth segment triangular with deep anterior, triangular
notch, a narrow bridge, and short posterior prolongation (the left longer than the
right).</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;Resembles the sternum of the Barnegat skeleton rather
than that of Newport skeleton, but anterior parts cartilaginous. Opposite sides of
second, third, and fifth segments anchylosed together and those of fourth segment
nearly so. (<a href="#Plate_25">Pl. 25</a>, fig. 2).</p>
<h4>SCAPULA.</h4>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;Superior border irregular. Posterior angle acute.
Anterior and posterior borders nearly straight. Ridges distinct. Acromion
broad both at base and at tip, sharply bent upward, so as to be parallel with anterior
border of scapula. Coracoid nearly as long as acromion, slender, a little curved
upward, irregular and somewhat expanded at the end.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;Superior border irregularly rounded. Posterior angle obtuse,
anterior angle projecting. Ridges indistinct. Anterior and posterior borders
nearly straight, but irregular. Acromion broad at base, tapering toward the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
tip, which is again somewhat expanded; bent upward, but not sufficiently to be
parallel with anterior margin of blade. Coracoid rather thick, irregular, strongly
expanded at tip.</p>
<p><i>Charleston</i> (female, jr.).&mdash;Rather too much abraded for comparisons, but posterior
margin more concave than in either of the other skeletons.</p>
<h4>FORE LIMB.</h4>
<p><i>Barnegat City</i> (female).&mdash;Fore limb much shorter than in the Newport skeleton.
Humerus: Head quite oblique, the lower edge overhanging the shaft considerably
on the ulnar side. Tuberosity level with upper surface of head, elliptical in outline
when viewed from above. Deltoid ridge moderately prominent, irregular, rugose,
and extending to about the middle of the shaft. Distal end of humerus not expanded.
Bicipital groove inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Radius: Almost perfectly straight, but a little inclined toward ulna at oblique
proximal end; scarcely expanded at distal end, which is lower externally than
internally.</p>
<p>Ulna: Much slenderer than radius, rounded triangular in section, not expanded
at distal end, where the margin is lowest externally. Olecranon well developed,
thin, and pointed proximally.</p>
<p>Carpals: Five; two on ulna side, two median and one on radial side in line with
first metacarpal. The proximal middle bone (intermedium) extends much farther
proximally than those on each side of it.</p>
<p>Metacarpals: Metacarpal III longest, metacarpal II broadest. Metacarpal I
oblong, or rather conical, with a lateral enlargement, and situated in line with the
distal row of carpals.</p>
<p>Digits: First phalange of first digit short and conical.</p>
<p><i>Newport</i> (male).&mdash;Fore limb considerably longer and more massive than that
of the Barnegat skeleton but similar otherwise, except as follows:</p>
<p>Humerus: Head rather larger and less inclined. Deltoid ridge more prominent.</p>
<p>Radius: Broader proximally and rounded at distal end, where it extends outward
beyond the carpal bones.</p>
<p>Ulna: Thicker, and olecranon less pointed.</p>
<p>Carpal bones: Middle carpal bone not extending farther proximally than those
on either side of it.</p>
<p>Metacarpals: Metacarpal I nearly square, third longest, second to fourth more
constricted.</p>
<p>Digits: First phalange of first digit long and cylindrical. Phalangeal formula:
I, 1; II, 6; III, 6; IV, 4; V, 2.</p>
<p>Measurements of the skeletons above described are as follows:</p>

<h4>SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES IN SKELETONS.</h4>
<p>The chief differences between the Barnegat City and Newport skeletons are in
the size and form of the processes of the cervical vertebr&aelig;, the form of the seventh
and eighth thoracic vertebr&aelig; and of the ribs connected with them, the direction of
the acromion of the scapula, the shape of the first phalange of the first digit, and
of the posterior segments of the sternum. As far as the processes of the cervicals
are concerned, these are known to be extremely variable in all cetaceans. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
seventh and eighth thoracic vertebr&aelig; are those on which the mode of attachment
of the ribs changes in ziphioid whales, and I have observed in the genus <i>Mesoplodon,</i>
as here, that the processes and articular facets were very variable, being sometimes
quite unlike on the two sides of the same vertebra. The direction of the acromion
is probably subject to large individual variations, though this can not be determined
at present, and the same is true of the form of the first phalange of the first
digit. The form of the sternum is quite variable in all cetaceans, and can not be
relied on for specific characters, without comparison of many individuals.</p>
<p>On the whole, I am of the opinion, as already stated, that we are not compelled
by the differences noted to regard the Barnegat and Newport skeletons as representing
different species. The Charleston skeleton is too young and imperfect to
admit of serious consideration. The idea that the differences between the adult
skeletons are probably individual receives support from the fact that the skeleton
shown in the photograph from St. Simon Island, Georgia, mentioned on <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>,
No. 14, appears to possess a combination of characters exhibited by the other two.</p>
<h4>AGE VARIATIONS IN SKULLS.</h4>
<p>The series of skulls of <i>Z. grebnitzkii</i>, which the Museum owes to the activities
of Dr. L. Stejneger and Mr. N. Grebnitzki, comprises specimens of different ages,
and, as will be shown presently, probably both sexes. Taken together with the
skulls from the east coast of the United States they probably represent very fully
the variations which the skull undergoes in the present species. These changes
may, perhaps, be best made evident by the following brief descriptions of the
various skulls:</p>
<p><i>21975. Charleston, South Carolina.</i>&mdash;Young female. (Type of <i>Z. semijunctus</i>.)
All sutures open, and elements of occipital bone distinguishable. No mesethmoid
ossification. Opposite maxillary notches, premaxill&aelig; closely approximated,
nearly flat and horizontal, and about level with adjacent parts of maxill&aelig;. Left
premaxilla grooved longitudinally at this point. Orifice of anterior nares on a
level with lower end of rectangular projecting boss formed by superior portion of
nasals. Rostrum pointed, much broader distally than it is deep. A very distinct
rudimentary alveolar groove in distal end of each maxilla. Proximal end of vomer
resting against anterior face of nasals and reaching up to overhanging boss. Anterior
face of the latter nearly flat. (<a href="#Plate_14">Pl. 14</a>, fig. 1; <a href="#Plate_18">pl. 18</a>, fig. 1; <a href="#Plate_20">pl. 20</a>, fig. 1; <a href="#Plate_21">pl. 21</a>, fig. 2.)</p>
<p>Rami of mandible not anchylosed together at symphysis. Teeth hollow,
open at the root, acute at apex, tipped with enamel; diameter 10 mm. (<a href="#Plate_22">Pl. 22</a>,

Condition of superior surface of skull very similar to that of preceding, but
premaxill&aelig; rather low at distal end. Mesirostral at distal end rather lower than
premaxill&aelig; and concave superiorly; more posteriorly assuming form of a narrow
ridge, with a deep channel between it and premaxill&aelig; on each side. More posteriorly
still it widens rapidly, with a convex surface, and terminates abruptly with a truncated

all on one level near apex of rostrum, but at extreme tip mesirostral lower,
forming a narrow ridge with a deep groove on each side between it and premaxill&aelig;.
The same conformation repeated more posteriorly, but grooves deeper and

<h4>SEX CHARACTERS.</h4>
<p>It will be found from an examination of the foregoing descriptions that in those
specimens in which the sex is known to be female, or is marked as such, the premaxill&aelig;
are comparatively narrow, the mesirostral ossification only slightly developed,
the prenarial basin undeveloped, and the teeth quite slender, with a diameter
of from 10 to 14 mm. As the teeth in some of them have closed roots there can be
no doubt that they are adults. On the other hand, those skulls known or believed
to be from adult males have the mesirostral ossification enormously developed,
a deep prenarial basin, and fusiform teeth with closed roots and a diameter of from
25 to 30 mm. It appears to be a fact, therefore, that in the females the mesirostral
ossification is never greatly developed at any age, that the teeth are never thick and
fusiform, and that the prenarial region is never deeply concave. Immature individuals
present, of course, the appearance of the females, except that the teeth
are open at the root and that the mesirostral ossification is not developed at all.
Conversely, the females, broadly speaking, always present characters of immaturity,
but in adults the roots of the teeth are, of course, closed.</p>
<p>That these conclusions are correct is borne out by an examination of descriptions
and figures of specimens from other parts of the world, for which purpose
a few are available in the writings of New Zealand zoologists and others. Hector,
for example, in 1873,<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>
published a description and figures of a skull from the Chatham
Islands which had a large mesirostral ossification, deep prenarial concavity,
and large, thick teeth, having a diameter of 34 mm. This is the same combination
of characters found in the Newport specimen, which is known to be a male, and the
Bering Island skulls supposed to be those of males.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>In 1876,<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a>
Haast figured and described a female 26 feet long, and hence presumably
adult, from Lyttleton Harbor, New Zealand, which had a small development
only of the mesirostral ossification, a slight prenarial depression, and rather
slender teeth with closed roots and a diameter of 19 mm. This combination of
characters is found in the Barnegat skull, also known to be an adult female.</p>
<p>In the same paper Haast
describes<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a>
and figures the skull of another female
from Akaroa Harbor, New Zealand. This individual was larger than the last and
was accompanied by a suckling calf. Hence, there can be no doubt that it was
mature. The skull shows a moderate development of the mesirostral ossification,
and slender cylindrical teeth with closed roots and a diameter of 16 mm.</p>
<p>It is demonstrated from the foregoing discussion, I think, that the sexes can be
distinguished by the skulls, when adult, or by the teeth alone.</p>
<p>Reverting now to <i>Ziphius gervaisii</i>, which was mentioned on <a href="#Page_30">p. 30</a> as perhaps
constituting a separate species, it will be seen by examining the figures given by
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
Gervais<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a>
of the skull on which it was based that the latter presents the combination
of characters peculiar to the female of <i>Z. cavirostris</i>. This skull, which was from
Aresquiers (H&eacute;rault), France, was 888 mm. long, and hence, presumably, adult.
The mesirostral ossification is but slightly developed, the prenarial concavity moderate,
the teeth small, slender, and cylindrical, with closed roots and a diameter of
14 mm. There seems to be no sufficient reason for regarding this skull as representing
a species distinct from <i>cavirostris</i>.</p>
<p>The specimen from Buenos Ayres described and figured by Burmeister in
1868<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a>
was an immature male. In the skull the mesirostral ossification was lacking, the
premaxill&aelig; were flat, and the teeth conical and acuminate, with open roots, and a
diameter of 12 mm. This individual was 12 feet 11&frac12; inches (3.95 m.) long, and
hence about as long as the Charleston specimen, but the skull was apparently 680
mm. long, while that of the Charleston specimen is 797 mm. long. In the latter
the teeth are 45 mm. long and 10 mm. in diameter, while the tooth figured by Burmeister
is 31 mm. long and 12 mm. in diameter. From these data it appears
improbable that the sex of immature individuals can be determined from the skull
or teeth.</p>
<h4>TEETH.</h4>

<p><i>21975. Charleston, South Carolina.</i>&mdash;Young female. (Type of <i>Z. semijunctus</i>.)
The teeth are slender, conical, and acuminate, largest at the base and tipped for
about 2 mm. with white enamel. The remainder of the teeth is coated with a thin
layer of cement. The teeth in what appears to be their natural position protrude
horizontally from the mandible for about 17 mm. They are slightly curved upward
near the tip and are oval, or elliptical, in section, the transverse diameter being
a little less than the vertical diameter. They are a little flattened externally.
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
The surface is smooth. They are open at the root, and hollow. (<a href="#Plate_38">Pl. 38</a>, figs. 1, 2;
<a href="#Plate_22">pl. 22</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<p>Doctor Manigault, curator of the Charleston Museum, wrote to Professor Cope
regarding these teeth, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another peculiarity of the head consists in the lower maxillary bones being provided each at its
point with a single small and very sharp tooth. These were not noticed during the dissection, owing
to their being too much embedded in the integuments.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>20971. Barnegat City, New Jersey.</i>&mdash;Adult female. The teeth are slender,
cylindrical, and irregularly pointed at both ends. The tips show what appears
to be an inner core of dentine which has been worn down nearly to the cement coating
and somewhat fractured. The cement coating is several millimeters thick,
but does not increase the diameter of the teeth near the middle, so that they remain
irregularly cylindrical throughout. The surface of the cement is rough and irregular.
The root is short, conical, and closed at the end. These teeth are nearly straight.
As they have been extracted from the jaw and the latter is broken it is not possible
to distinguish which is the upper and which the lower surface, but they are irregularly
oval in section, and a little compressed. (<a href="#Plate_38">Pl. 38</a>, figs. 3-5.)</p>
<p>In my original notes on this specimen, I recorded that there was a small pair
of teeth behind the larger ones described above. Mention of these will be made
again later. (See <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>.)</p>
<p><i>22069. Bering Island.</i>&mdash;Adult female (?). The teeth are in position in this
specimen and are nearly horizontal in position, but a little inclined upward and
toward each other. They do not extend beyond the tip of the jaw nor up to the
level of the upper surface of the symphysis, but protrude about 13 mm. beyond
the alveoli on the side. They are rather slender, somewhat fusiform, blunt at both
ends and slightly curved upward. The surface is irregular. They are nearly
round in section. The root is closed, and the apex shows what appears to be a
core of dentine surrounded by cement. There is a depression on the inner side
near the root. These teeth are remarkable as intermediate in form between those
of the preceding specimen and those of the specimens next to be mentioned.
(<a href="#Plate_38">Pl. 38</a>, figs. 6, 7; <a href="#Plate_22">pl. 22</a>, fig. 3.)</p>
<p><i>20993. Bering Island.</i>&mdash;Adult male (?). (Type of <i>Z. grebnitzkii</i>.) These
teeth are almond-shaped and very symmetrical. They are thickest near the base
and taper gradually to the tip, which is quite acute. They are somewhat compressed
and hence elliptical in section, the vertical diameter being greater than the transverse
diameter. One side (probably the inner) is flattened. They are slightly
curved upward toward the apex, which is a little worn and fractured. The root
is very short and conical. It is nearly closed, but a very small canal extends upward
for about 10 mm. The surface of the tooth is quite smooth, but dull in the lower
half. The line of demarcation between cement and dentine is not evident. (<a href="#Plate_38">Pl. 38</a>,
figs. 8, 9; <a href="#Plate_23">pl. 23</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<p><i>21248. Bering Island.</i>&mdash;Adult male (?). In this specimen the teeth are still
in the natural position in the jaw. They are held in place by ligaments and protrude
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
far beyond the alveoli, only about one-ninth of their length being below
the superior border. They incline forward at an angle of about 45&deg; with the longitudinal
axis of the jaw and diverge slightly at the tips.</p>
<p>The teeth themselves have the same general form as those of the preceding
specimen, but are larger. The inner surface is flattened and the outer strongly
convex. The tips are quite pointed, but show some indications of wear. The
roots can not be seen distinctly, but appear to be closed. (<a href="#Plate_22">Pl. 22</a>, fig. 4.)</p>
<p><i>49599. Newport, Rhode Island.</i>&mdash;Adult male. These teeth are longer than those
of the preceding specimen, and while they resemble the latter in general form, taper
much more gradually to the tip. The root, or portion below the point of maximum
girth, is much shorter than that above, and rugose, with several deep furrows. A
very small circular opening at the base of the root marks the orifice of the nerve.
The upper half of the teeth is smooth, and the tips slightly worn and fractured.
The small elliptical worn area is situated on the convex side of the tooth, which
appears to be the outer side. As the alveoli of the jaw are, however, filled with a
network of bone, the teeth can not be inserted in them. They were detached when
received. (<a href="#Plate_38">Pl. 38</a>, figs. 10, 11; <a href="#Plate_22">pl. 22</a>, fig. 2; <a href="#Plate_23">pl. 23</a>, figs. 2, 3.)</p>
<p>Besides the difference in the size and form of the teeth in the two sexes, it is
probable, as will be seen by consulting the foregoing data, that in the female the
apex of the teeth does not extend more than a very small distance above the alveoli
even in mature individuals, and probably often not more than a few millimeters;
while in adult males the teeth are almost entirely protruded from the alveoli, which
are filled with a coarse bony network. These differences are carried out in all the
American specimens, and also characterized the New Zealand specimens, as may be
learned from the accounts of Haast and Hector.</p>
<p>A number of rudimentary teeth in addition to the large terminal pair have
been noted in the Aresquiers, Buenos Ayres, and perhaps other specimens, and
two such teeth were found in the mandible of the Barnegat specimen, behind the
large pair. One of these rudimentary teeth has been preserved. It is cylindrical
and moderately curved. The length is 16 mm. and the diameter 2 mm. The whole
tooth, with the exception of the extreme tip, is thickly coated with cement. The
root is closed and the crown acute and apparently abraded by use. (<a href="#Plate_38">Pl. 38</a>, fig. 5.)</p>
<p>Returning now to the question of the validity of <i>grebnitzkii</i> as a species, I would
say that after comparing the measurements of the Bering Island skulls with those
of the Atlantic coast specimens, and comparing the skulls themselves, I have been
unable to find any constant difference of importance, except the size and form of
the periotic bone. As the earbones are lacking from many of the skulls, the series
available for comparison is small.</p>
<p>As compared with the Atlantic coast specimens, the anterior portion of the
periotic bone in <i>grebnitzkii</i> is larger, broader, and more rectangular in outline
when viewed from below. I observe, however, that the absolute size and outline
of the periotic vary considerably in the different specimens of <i>grebnitzkii</i> without
relation to age. The same appears to be true of <i>cavirostris</i>, but comparing the two
series of skulls as a whole it appears to be true that the anterior mass of the periotic
is larger in <i>grebnitzkii</i>. I do not think, however, that the latter species should be
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
kept distinct on this account alone, at least until the character has been confirmed,
and perhaps strengthened by others, through the examination of a larger series of
specimens.</p>
<h4>SKELETON OF ZIPHIUS FROM BERING ISLAND.</h4>
<p>The Museum collection contains an incomplete skeleton of a very young individual,
Cat. No. 22875, which was received from Bering Island with the skulls of
<i>Z. grebnitzkii</i>, but does not belong to any one of them. Whether it really represents
that species is, therefore, uncertain, but such is probably the case. The length of
the vertebral column, consisting of 45 vertebr&aelig;, without interspaces, is 9 feet
2 inches.</p>
<p>The vertebral formula is as follows: C. 7; Th. 10; L. 10; Ca. 18 (+1?) = 45 (+1?).
This is the same as in the type of <i>semijunctus</i> so far as the cervicals, thoracics, and
lumbars are concerned, and the probable total is the same. In their general
characters these vertebr&aelig; agree with those of the skeletons already described, but
they present a number of differences as well. On account of immaturity the
processes are even less developed than in <i>semijunctus</i>. All the epiphyses are free,
and in the third to the seventh thoracic vertebr&aelig; the neural arch and spine are
separate from the centrum. The centra are very short in proportion to their width.</p>
<p>Although the specimen is so young, the anterior foramen of the atlas is, nevertheless,
inclosed by bone, and though the line of separation between the atlas and
axis is visible on the sides, the fourth cervical is anchylosed to the third at the top
of the centrum. Although the neural spines, metapophyses, and transverse processes
of the thoracics are much shorter than those of the young <i>semijunctus</i>, the
epiphyses are as large or even larger than in that specimen. The neural arches are
also noticeably thicker than in <i>semijunctus</i>, and the centra are rounded inferiorly
rather than carinated. The neural spines are much more nearly erect than in the
adult Barnegat and Newport skeletons, but, as mentioned on <a href="#Page_41">page 41</a>, this is
probably a character of immaturity, and is shared by <i>semijunctus</i>.</p>
<p>The differences as regards the form of the centra and neural arches die away
among the lumbars, and these vertebr&aelig; and the caudals are, with a due allowance
for greater immaturity, very similar to those of <i>semijunctus</i>.</p>
<p>The seventh thoracic is like the sixth in form, and is without a transverse
process. It thus resembles the same vertebra in <i>semijunctus</i>. The eighth, however,
has an ill-defined facet on the side of the metapophysis and a second facet a
little above the upper border of the centrum. The eighth pair of ribs has only a
single terminal articular facet.</p>
<p>The ninth thoracic has a short, thick transverse process, about in line with the
upper surface of the centrum.</p>
<p>The transverse process of the seventh caudal is perforated on the right side by
a foramen. The transverse processes are last traceable on the ninth caudal, the
neural spines on the tenth caudal, and the neural arch on the eleventh caudal.
Eight chevron bones are preserved, but probably two more were present originally.</p>
<p>Ten pairs of ribs are present. The first is much broader in the proximal half
than in the distal half, but the distal end is slightly expanded. The first seven pairs
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
possess both head and tubercle, but the eighth, ninth, and tenth have only a single
terminal articular facet.</p>
<p>The sternum, which consists of five segments, is similar in form to that of
<i>semijunctus</i>. The two sides of each segment are united. The posterior emargination
of the third segment, and those of both ends of the fourth and fifth segments
are small. The scapula and humerus are like those of <i>semijunctus</i> in form. The
remaining parts of both pectoral limbs are lacking.</p>
<p>Without more material, and especially some skeletons of adults, it is difficult
to decide what importance should be assigned to the differences observable in the
cervical and thoracic vertebr&aelig; of this young Bering Island specimen. The
measurements of the skeleton are included in the table on pages <a class="rp" href="#Page_47">47</a> and <a class="rp" href="#Page_48">48</a>.</p>
<h4>EXTERNAL CHARACTERS.</h4>
<p>The series of photographs (Cat. No. 142579) of an individual obtained in Kiska
Harbor, Alaska, is very interesting as affording comparison of what is apparently a
specimen of <i>grebnitzkii</i> with the Atlantic form represented in the photograph of
the Newport, Rhode Island, specimen. As no part of the Kiska specimen was
preserved, it is not possible, of course, to identify it positively with <i>grebnitzkii</i> or
even with the genus <i>Ziphius</i>. No one who compares the photographs reproduced
in <a href="#Plate_41">Pl. 41</a>, figs. 3 and 4, can, I think, fail to be convinced that both represent animals
of the same genus and that the Pacific species (whether <i>grebnitzkii</i> or not) bears the
strongest possible resemblance to the Atlantic one.</p>
<p>Doctor Egbert published the following note on the Kiska specimen in 1905:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early in September a monster dolphin grounded on the beach in Kiska Harbor and was killed.
Specific identification has not yet been made. The general color was bluish-gray; length, 18&frac12; feet;
estimated weight, 3,600 pounds; sex, male. Body was quite regular in shape and rather rotund, the
greatest circumference being about midway between dorsal fin and tip of the rather short snout. This
dolphin was hauled alongside the ship, stripped of its blubber, and the oil extracted. Some of the flesh
was eaten. The oil obtained was of excellent quality. It was particularly desired for use on the wire
of the deep-sea sounding machine used aboard the
[U. S. Coast Survey steamer] <i>Patterson</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The size was about the same as that of the Newport specimen. Although
Doctor Egbert gives the color merely as &ldquo;bluish gray,&rdquo; the photographs indicate
that the belly was white, or whitish, and that there were oval white spots on the
sides. As a whole, therefore, the coloration was similar to that of the New Zealand
specimens of <i>cavirostris</i> obtained at Port Cooper and Lyttleton Harbor.</p>
<p>When compared with the photograph of the Newport specimen (<a href="#Plate_41">Pl. 41</a>, fig. 4)
it will be seen that the Kiska photograph represents an animal practically identical in
general form, as well as in the general shape of the head, the length and form of the
snout, the size and general shape of the pectoral fins. In the photograph of the Newport
specimen the flukes are not well seen, but in the Kiska photograph the posterior
median convexity peculiar to the ziphioids is clearly represented. The dorsal fin
of the Newport specimen appears to be turned somewhat to one side and the tip
crumpled, which makes it appear lower and somewhat longer and less pointed than
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
that of the Kiska specimen. This may, of course, be a real difference, though such
is probably not the case.</p>
<p>Considering the foregoing data relative to <i>grebnitzkii</i> as a whole, there is not in
my opinion sufficient warrant at present for considering this form as a species
distinct from <i>cavirostris</i>, and it should be added that no distinguishing characters
were given in the original description.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><br /><span class="small">Genus BERARDIUS Duvernoy.</span></h2>
<p>Of this genus the National Museum has three skulls and three skeletons representing the
species <i>bairdii</i>, and a skull representing the species <i>arnuxii</i>. The latter,
Cat. No. 21511, U.S.N.M., is without exact locality, but is catalogued as having been
obtained in New Zealand. As the species <i>arnuxii</i> has been well described and figured
by Flower<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a>
and others, no detailed account of this skull is given here. Measurements of it,
however, are included with those of <i>B. bairdii</i> in the table on <a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c11">BERARDIUS BAIRDII Stejneger.</h3>
<dl class="undent"><dd><i>Berardius bairdii</i> <span class="sc">Stejneger</span>, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., vol. 6, p. 75, June 22, 1883.</dd>
<dd><i>Berardius veg&aelig;</i> <span class="sc">Malm</span>, Bihang K. Svenska Vet. Akad. Handl., vol. 8, 1883, No. 4, p. 109.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a></dd></dl>
<p>This species was based by Dr. L. Stejneger on a skull obtained by Mr. N. Grebnitzki
in Stare Gavan, on the eastern shore of Bering Island, Commander Group,
Bering Sea, in the autumn of 1881. In 1879 a portion of a skull of the same species
was found on Bering Island by the <i>Vega</i> expedition, and was made the basis of a
new species, <i>B. veg&aelig;</i>, by A. W. Malm, the description of which was published a few
months after that of Doctor Stejneger. The National Museum subsequently
received another skull from Bering Island, through Mr. N. Grebnitzki, but, so far
as I am aware, nothing further was heard of the species until 1903 and 1904, when
the National Museum received three nearly complete skeletons, two of them from
St. George Island, Pribilof Group, Bering Sea, and one from the coast of California.
The material now in the National Museum is as follows:<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a></p>
<p>(1) <i>Cat. No. 20992</i>.&mdash;Skull and mandible of an immature individual collected
by Dr. L. Stejneger in Bering Island. Original number 1520. Catalogued November
24, 1883. Type.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Cat. No.</i> (lacking).&mdash;Skull and mandible of an immature individual. Collected
by Mr. N. Grebnitzki in Bering Island (?). Mounted.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Cat. No. 142118</i>.&mdash;Skull, mandible, and cervical vertebr&aelig; of a very young
individual. Collected by Dr. L. Stejneger, June 5, 1883, on North Rookery, Bering
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Island. Original number 2191. This specimen is accompanied by notes and
measurements.</p>
<p>(4) <i>Cat. No. 49726</i>.&mdash;Skeleton and measurements of an adult female. Near
East Rookery, St. George Island, Pribilof Group. Collected by James Judge, in
June, 1903. Length, 40 feet 2 inches.</p>
<p>(5) <i>Cat. No. 49727</i>.&mdash;Skeleton and measurements of an immature male. Same
locality and date as the preceding. Length, 25 feet 5 inches.</p>
<p>The two skeletons (4) and (5) are somewhat incomplete. The Museum received
a photograph of the female from Maj. Ezra W. Clark.</p>
<p>(6) <i>Cat. No. 49725</i>.&mdash;Skeleton and two photographs of an adult male (?)
stranded on Centerville beach near Ferndale, Humboldt County, California, October,
1904. Length, about 41 feet.</p>
<p>A brief note on the St. George Island and California skeletons was published
by the author in Science for 1904.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a>
The dimensions given by the collectors were
so large as to raise doubts whether they were correct, but the arrival of the skeletons
proved that they were not overstated, and that the specimens were by far the
largest ziphioid whales ever discovered, the bones about equaling those of a humpback
whale in size and massiveness.</p>
<h4>HISTORY OF THE ST. GEORGE ISLAND SPECIMENS.</h4>
<p>The St. George Island specimens were first made known by Mr. James Judge,
special agent of the Treasury Department, resident at the Pribilof Islands, in a letter
dated June 16, 1903, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was much surprised the other day to find a pair of whales ashore near East Rookery [St. George
Island]. They lay about 150 yards apart. The female was 40 feet 2 inches, the male 25 feet 5 inches
in length. The species is not positively identified, but tallies closely with the Globe Encyclopedia
description of Bottlehead or Bottlenose whale, <i>Hyperodo&ouml;n bidentatus</i>. Natives call it &ldquo;Tcha-dhan.&rdquo;
The male is without teeth; female has two teeth in front of lower jaw.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> The skin is thin, smooth, white
underneath, and black above. Dorsal fin small and well aft. Caudal large and powerful. Eyes very
small. Ears not visible.</p>
<p>Thinking that the skeleton might be of use, the bones of the female were cut out and placed high
and dry on the grass. Four ribs were broken; otherwise the bones are intact. The male was towed to
East Landing, and with the aid of a capstan deposited beyond reach of surf. Some blubber was saved.
The foxes will clean up the bones during August, so that in all probability both skeletons will be available
this fall. * * * I inclose some measurements, taken roughly, with a 5-foot tape line.</p>

<p>The skeletons remained on the island until August, 1904, when they were
carried by the revenue cutter <i>McCulloch</i> to Dutch Harbor and afterwards to San
Francisco. Through a misunderstanding they were allowed to remain on the
beach at St. George Island until November, 1903, and suffered considerable injury.
On that date they were deposited in a storehouse by Maj. Ezra W. Clark, assistant
treasury agent in charge, who afterwards presented the photograph of the female
above mentioned. (<a href="#Plate_42">Pl. 42</a>, fig. 1.) The latter shows the short, narrow, pointed
pectoral fin, and long, rather slender beak.</p>
<p>Another specimen of <i>Berardius</i> was found stranded on St. George Island on
August 21, 1909. The following information regarding it was received from Maj.
Ezra W. Clark, under date of September 4, 1909:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On August 21, 1909, after an unusually severe gale for the season, accompanied with heavy sea, a
beaked whale was stranded under the cliffs of the northeast coast of St. George Island. Its position
was such that it was reached with great difficulty. It was undergoing decomposition. I succeeded in
getting the following information:</p>
</blockquote>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Sex, female.</dt>
<dt>Length from tip of beak to end of body, 22 feet.</dt>
<dt>Length of beak, tip to base, 2 feet 5 inches.</dt>
<dt>Length of head, not including beak, 2 feet.</dt>
<dt>Length of tail, or width of flukes at base, 1 foot 10 inches.</dt>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that I shall not be able to get the skeleton of this whale, owing to the rough seas prevailing.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<h4>HISTORY OF THE CENTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, SPECIMEN.</h4>
<p>The Californian specimen (Cat. No. 49725) was first made known in a letter
addressed to me by President Jordan, of Stanford University, under date of October
27, 1904, inclosing one from Mr. J. H. Ring, of Ferndale, California, dated October
23, 1904, which was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enclosed find three views of an animal stranded on the beach near this place [Ferndale, Humboldt
County, California], and as its identity seems rather uncertain we hope you will kindly classify it and
inform us of its true name and habitat, if possible, from the photographs and incomplete description.
Its total length is about 41 feet. Greatest circumference 16 feet, tapering probably to 18 inches near
the tail. It also tapers toward the head, terminating in a sharp beak, the upper jaw being about 16
and the lower 19 inches long.</p>
<p>On each side in the lower jaw well to the front is a conical tooth, the crown of which is exposed one-half
an inch. The head is full and rounded, resembling that of an elephant, with depressions corresponding
to the ears, and small eyes a little ahead and below.</p>
<p>On top of head is a heart-shaped opening, evidently for breathing purposes. There is also evidence
of a dorsal fin, while each fork of tail is 3&frac12; feet or so long. The underside of the animal is too bruised
to show anything of importance. The flippers are also in bad shape, one being buried in the sand,
while the other is entirely denuded of flesh, leaving a bony stump about 6 inches long and which moves
readily in any direction. We think it is a &ldquo;bottle-nose&rdquo; whale, but as some claim that they are not
to be found on this coast and do not exceed 30 feet in length, it may be something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Ring was immediately communicated with, and very generously presented
to the Museum the skull of the animal, which he had secured and cleaned with much
labor and some danger to himself. He also undertook to have the skeleton cleaned
and sent to Washington, and it was received in due course in June, 1905. Mr.
Ring wrote under date of May 15, 1905:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will notice that the point of the beak, as well as the points of the lower jawbones, are a little
damaged, some hunters having shot the teeth out and then set a fire inside the jaws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When received, the skeleton lacked the flippers and also two of the teeth.
Regarding the former, Mr. Ring wrote on November 18, 1905, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote you that one flipper was entirely gone and the other worn down to a stump, as shown in the
picture. I have interviewed the man who stripped the specimen, and he says the stump was badly
crushed and broken and fears it was lost one night when the extremely high tide had turned the whale
over, and only the anchors and lashings I had secured it with prevented its going out to sea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This skeleton was mounted recently and placed on exhibition in the Museum.
The flippers were modeled from those of the St. George Island specimens (which
were also imperfect) and from the figures of <i>B. arnuxii</i> given by Flower. The end
of the beak was also restored, and a facsimile of the teeth substituted for the real
ones. This remarkable skeleton shows in a manner hitherto unapproached the great
size which this genus of ziphioid whales attains, and the peculiar conformation of
the body. While the vertebr&aelig; rival those of the large whalebone whales, such as
the Humpbacks, in their dimensions, the head is remarkable for its small size as
compared with the immense proportions of the same part in the Right whales.
(<a href="#Plate_42">Pl. 42</a>, fig. 4.)</p>
<p>Mr. Ring sent to the Museum three photographs of the Californian specimen
above mentioned, two of which are reproduced on <a href="#Plate_42">Pl. 42</a>, figs. 2 and 3. Although
rather indistinct, they show the general form of the body, the peculiar bulbous
head, with an indication of a neck, and the long beak.</p>

<h4>DESCRIPTION OF A YOUNG BERING ISLAND SPECIMEN.</h4>
<p>Doctor Stejneger has very kindly placed in my hands his original notes on the
young individual examined by him in Bering Island June 5, 1883 (Cat. No. 142,188)

<blockquote>
<p>When the news reached me that a small &ldquo;plavum&rdquo; was found dead ashore at the North Rookery of
Bering Island, I immediately ordered dogs, and arrived at the place in company with the &ldquo;starost.&rdquo;
The carcass was found lying on the very beach where the fur seals during the summer occupy the ground.
As the bulk of the seals had not yet arrived, only a few &ldquo;sikatschi&rdquo; were seen in the immediate neighborhood,
but it was reported that they had retired from the place on account of the smell of the putrefied
body, as it was thought. The natives, fearing that it would drive the seals from the rookery altogether
if left on the beach any longer, were very anxious to get it away as fast as possible, and it was only with
some hesitation that they would allow one to stand on the rookery long enough to take a few measurements.
The animal was quite a young one, and I conjectured that it had died immediately after having
been born, as I think there were some remains of the umbilical cord. Hardly any of the bones were
fully ossified. Under these circumstances, it was out of the question to have the whole skeleton preserved,
as the dismembering and the separation of the putrified flesh from the bones and cartilages
would require more care and consequently more time than the natives were willing to allow. I was
therefore glad to secure the head and some of the neck vertebr&aelig;. Even that tried their patience, as
the head was going to separate into its single bones and the not yet united component pieces, and consequently
needed special care and attention.</p>
<p>The carcass was lying with the back upward, this visible part being uniform black, and still in
such a state as to allow of measuring. The lower surface was in a very advanced state of decomposition.
Part of the belly was torn away, together with the entrails, and the genitalia and anus were not to be
found. As stated above, I think that I could recognize the umbilical cord attached to a tatter of the
skin. Of course, measurements of the lower side and of the circumference of the body, except at the
narrowest place of the tail, could not be taken.</p>

<h4>ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION OF BERARDIUS BAIRDII.</h4>
<p>The original description of <i>B. bairdii</i> by Doctor Stejneger is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides an <i>Orca</i>, which is said to visit the rookeries, but of which I have not been able to procure
any specimen, or even to see one, there are at least two species of the family <i>Ziphiid&aelig;</i>, both undescribed,
as I suppose. I am very much indebted to Mr. Grebnitzki for a skull of each of the species, for one of
which I should like to propose the name <i>Berardius bairdii</i>, as a slight token of my esteem and gratitude.</p>
<p>As I am now almost without any literary means, I find it impossible to decide with certainty
in what genus this species will finally have to be placed. But I think that the supposition that this
specimen (No. 1520) is a young <i>Berardius</i> may not be far out of the way. At first I suspected that it
is a <i>Dioplodon</i>, but the size of the skull, in connection with the distinctness of the sutures, the evident
maxillary crests, and the terminal position of the teeth very soon led me to the above conclusion.</p>
<p>The specimen in question has very low and scarcely incurved maxillary crests; the shortest distance
of which is two and two-thirds times greater than their greatest height, and although it still is in its
&ldquo;adolescent&rdquo; stage, I should greatly doubt whether the crests in this species ever become developed
to such a degree as, for instance, in <i>Hypero&ouml;don diodon</i> (Lac&eacute;p.). The groove between the maxillary
and the nuchal crest is very shallow. The maxillary notch is deep. The beak is long, making only
a little less than half the length of the entire skull. Nares straight; right nasal larger than the left one,
but not very much. The occipital condyles do not come in contact beneath the foramen magnum;
the symphysis of the lower jaw is very short, amounting to only one-fifth of the whole length of the jaw.</p>
<p>Want of time and books prevents me from making more extended remarks, and until I can present
an exhaustive and comparative description, I shall have to content myself by giving a provisional table
of dimensions. The following dimensions are in millimeters and English inches, and are in every case
measured in a straight line:</p>

<p>This specimen was found stranded in Stare Gavan, on the eastern shore of Bering Island in the fall
of last year, and only the skull was preserved. From analogy I should judge that the entire length of
the animal must have been about 18 feet (5&frac12; meters). This species is well known by the natives for the
cathartic quality of the blubber, resembling in this respect the Atlantic &ldquo;D&ouml;gling,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Anarnak&rdquo; (<i>Hypero&ouml;don
diodon</i>). The Russian name, by which the inhabitants here designate this whale, is <i>Pla-un</i>
(sp. Pl&auml;oon), while the Aleut name is <i>Kigan agalusoch</i>, the meaning of which is said to be &ldquo;having
teeth on the nose,&rdquo; a very inappropriate designation, as the teeth are situated on the tip of the lower
jaw, and not on the nose.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>SIZE.</h4>
<p>It will be observed that the largest of the foregoing specimens measured 40
feet 2 inches in length, while the Centerville skeleton was reported to be about 41
feet long. The largest example of the New Zealand species, <i>B. arnuxii</i>, of which
there is a record was 32 feet long.</p>
<h4>COLORATION.</h4>
<p>The St. George Island specimens were reported to be black on the back and
white below, but it is not certain how long they had been dead when found by Mr.
Judge. The young individual examined by Doctor Stejneger was also black on
the back, but this was in a state of decomposition.</p>
<p>The color of the type-specimen of <i>Berardius arnuxii</i> was described by Arnoux
as follows: &ldquo;Its color was entirely black, except for a light gray area near the genital
organs; it was a male.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a>
Haast remarks of a young individual observed by him
near New Brighton, New Zealand, and not in a fresh condition: &ldquo;The color of the
whole animal was of a deep, velvety black, with the exception of the lower portion
of the belly, which had a grayish color.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
<p>The color of the immature male of <i>B. arnuxii</i> captured in Wellington Harbor,
New Zealand, in 1877, and described by Hector, was as follows: &ldquo;The colour was
black with a purple hue, except a narrow band along the belly, which was grey.
The muzzle, flippers, and tail lobes were intensely black.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>It is not likely that there is any marked difference in the color of <i>arnuxii</i> and
<i>bairdii</i>, but the data available are insufficient for the determination of the matter.
It will be observed, however, that Mr. Judge stated that the male <i>bairdii</i> found on
St. George Island was white below, while in all the accounts of <i>arnuxii</i> the color of
the under surface is given as blackish, with a restricted area of gray.</p>
<p>Besides its apparently greater size, <i>Berardius bairdii</i> differs from <i>B. arnuxii</i> in
various cranial and other osteological characters, as well as in external proportions,
and is to be regarded as a distinct species. The external measurements of the
St. George Island specimens reduced to percentages of the total length and compared
with similar measurements of a specimen of <i>B. arnuxii</i> described by Hector,
are as follows:</p>

<p>The measurements of these specimens of <i>bairdii</i> agree well together. The
specimen of <i>arnuxii</i> appears to have had narrower flukes, shorter pectoral fin, and
a rather higher dorsal fin, situated farther forward than in <i>bairdii</i>. Measurements
of a larger number of specimens might show that some or all of these differences of
proportion are elusive, but it will be observed that in the Wellington specimen of
<i>arnuxii</i>, recorded by Doctor Haast, the breadth of the flukes is only 21 per cent of
the total length. The pectoral fin is said to be only 19 inches long, or only 5.2 per
cent of the total length, but the manner of taking the measurement is not mentioned.</p>
<p>As regards size, the largest specimen of <i>B. arnuxii</i> of which I find record is the
type specimen. This was 32 feet long, and the skull 1,400 mm., or about 55 inches
long. This appears to have been an adult male. The Centerville specimen of
<i>bairdii</i>, which was an adult male, was about 41 feet long, and the skull 1,532 mm.,
or about 60 inches long, while the adult female from St. George Island was 40 feet
2 inches long and the skull 56 inches. Although the total length of the specimens
of <i>bairdii</i> is so much greater, it will be observed that the length of the skull, while a
little greater, absolutely fails to measure up to the proportions found in <i>arnuxii</i>.
It might be suspected on this account that the external measurements of <i>bairdii</i>
were exaggerated, but that such is not the case will appear from an examination of
the measurements of vertebr&aelig; given on page 75. It is evident that the specimens
of <i>bairdii</i> are far more massive in all parts of the skeleton than the specimen of
<i>arnuxii</i> there cited. The same relations will be found upon comparing measurements
of the specimen of <i>arnuxii</i> figured by Van Beneden and Gervais.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> The
truth appears to be that <i>bairdii</i> is a much larger species, but that the skull is
considerably smaller relatively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h4>SKULL.</h4>
<p>The skull of <i>Berardius bairdii</i> presents many characters by which it may be
distinguished from that of <i>arnuxii</i>, whether adult or young. As compared with
the latter, the rostrum is less massive at the base. The pterygoid has a rounded
extension posteriorly and superiorly, so that the posterior portion of the upper
border of the pterygoid sinus is convex, rather than nearly straight, as in <i>arnuxii</i>.
The exoccipital is larger and broader distally below, and its external surface is
plane or concave, rather than convex, as in <i>arnuxii</i>. The distal end of the zygomatic
process is much more incurved. The nasal bones instead of presenting
lateral extensions have nearly straight sides. The vomer is deeply emarginate at
the base of the skull posteriorly where it rests against the presphenoid. The palatines
extend scarcely or not at all in front of the pterygoids. The foregoing differences
will readily be seen by comparing the figures on Pls. 26-29 with those of the
type of <i>B. arnuxii</i> given in Van Beneden and Gervais&rsquo;s Osteography, plate 23.</p>

<h4>EARBONES.</h4>
<p>The tympanic and periotic bones of <i>B. bairdii</i> (Pls. <a href="#Plate_34">34</a>-<a href="#Plate_37">37</a>) present a number
of characters by which they may be distinguished from those of <i>B. arnuxii</i>. While
of about the same size in both species, the two bones when in the natural position,
viewed from without, are nearly square rather than triangular in outline in <i>B.
bairdii</i>, the superior border of the periotic being nearly parallel with the inferior
border of the tympanic, and the anterior lobe of the periotic being turned down
nearly at right angles with the rest of the bone. The periotic is shorter anteriorly
than the tympanic in <i>B. bairdii</i>, while the reverse is true in <i>B. arnuxii</i>. In the
former species the eustachian canal of the tympanic is wider, the distance between
the outer and inner lips being greater. The involuted portion of the inner lip is
shorter and differently shaped. The groove between the postero-inferior lobes is
wider. The periotic beside having a much shorter anterior lobe than in <i>B. arnuxii</i>
has also a smaller and smoother middle lobe, and the internal auditory meatus is
smaller and more oblique. The dimensions of the bones in the Centerville beach
skull, No. 49725, are as follows: <i>Tympanic</i>: greatest length, 62 mm.; greatest
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
breadth, 46; least breadth of eustachian canal, 17; height at sigmoid process, 47.
<i>Periotic:</i> greatest length, 66; greatest breadth, 40; height at center of middle lobe,
35; length from tip of anterior lobe to anterior margin of internal meatus, 38.</p>
<h4>TEETH.</h4>
<p>Although all the specimens of <i>Berardius bairdii</i> are more or less incomplete,
two or three of the mandibular teeth have been preserved in nearly every instance;
namely, in the adult female from St. George Island, the left anterior and right and
left posterior; in the immature male from the same island, both anterior teeth;
in the Centerville beach specimen, the left anterior and right (?) posterior teeth;
in the skull from Bering Island formerly regarded as the type, all four teeth; in the
very young skull from Bering Island, the left anterior and posterior teeth.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, these teeth are not larger than those found in the specimens
of <i>B. arnuxii</i> thus far recorded, but in both species they vary so much on account
of age, or for other reasons, that a comparison of dimensions is unsatisfactory.

<p>A description of the teeth of the different specimens of <i>B. bairdii</i> is subjoined.</p>
<p><i>No. 142118.</i>&mdash;Bering Island; young (new born?). Anterior tooth conical,
hollow, with thin walls. The lower half of the tooth is filled with a mass of bony
pulp, which is separable. The tooth is widest at the base, and is without any constriction
indicating the formation of a root. Outer and inner surfaces slightly
convex, the latter with several distinct longitudinal furrows, which extend to the
apex. The whole tooth has a thin coating of cement, except the tip, for a length of
about 10 mm., which is more nearly white, and consists, presumably, of dentine.
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
The tooth is very symmetrical, but rather more convex externally. The apex is
pointed, erect, and a little more convex externally than internally. (<a href="#Plate_39">Pl. 39</a>, figs. 1, 2.)</p>
<p>The posterior tooth is similar to the anterior one, but much shorter and more
blunt, and the longitudinal furrows are about equally distinct externally and
internally. The cement extends nearly to the apex, which latter is very short and
is directed backward.</p>
<p><i>No. 49727.</i>&mdash;St. George Island, Alaska; male, immature. Anterior teeth conical,
acute, somewhat unsymmetrical, rather more convex externally than internally.
The internal surface with a deep median longitudinal groove, and others less distinct
on each side near the base. Apex slightly inclined forward and inward, convex
externally, with a single longitudinal groove; nearly flat internally, with, or without,
a groove. Base of tooth for about 17 mm. covered with longitudinal rugosities,
indicating that the root was about to close. It is open, however, the walls of the
tooth at the narrowest point being 8 mm. apart and the cavity filled with dense
bony pulp. The anterior and posterior outlines of the teeth are irregular, being
convex near the base, then slightly concave, and again convex near the apex. When
in the natural position, these teeth protrude about 33 mm., or a little more than
one-third their height, above the alveolus. (<a href="#Plate_39">Pl. 39</a>, figs. 3, 4.)</p>
<p>Posterior teeth lacking.</p>
<p><i>No. 49725.</i>&mdash;Centerville beach, California; male (?), adult. Anterior tooth
conical, with anterior and posterior margins as in the last. Apex considerably
abraded and rounded off; not inclined inward or forward. Internal and external
surfaces nearly equally convex, but the former with a broad median longitudinal
groove. Root closed, the base of the tooth for a breadth of about 30 mm. covered
with rounded rugosities. The inferior border slightly convex and the angles
rounded off. When in the natural position, somewhat more than one-half of the
tooth protrudes beyond the alveolus, and the tooth itself is inclined forward and
outward. (<a href="#Plate_39">Pl. 39</a>, fig. 5.)</p>
<p>Posterior tooth quite irregular in form, but the portion above the rugose base
or root conical. Inner surface flat and uneven. Outer surface convex and rather
rugose. The cement covers the whole tooth thickly to within about 5 mm. of the
apex, which latter is short, quite acute, and slightly directed inward. It is convex
externally and nearly flat internally. The basal rugosity or root is conical, thicker
than the rest of the tooth, and unsymmetrical, being somewhat directed backward.
It shows no opening below. When in the natural position this tooth is strongly
inclined forward and outward, and only the tip for a length of 22 mm. protrudes
beyond the alveolus. (<a href="#Plate_39">Pl. 39</a>, fig. 6.)</p>
<p><i>No. 49726.</i>&mdash;St. George Island, Alaska; female, adult. Anterior tooth conical,
with the tip blunt, having been so much abraded that the dentine does not extend
beyond the coating of cement. The tip measures 26 by 19 mm. The external and
internal surfaces of the tooth are about equally convex and somewhat rugose without
distinct furrows. The root is thicker than the remainder of the tooth and very
rugose. It is entirely closed below, and the inferior outline is convex. Posterior
tooth much compressed, conical above the root, nearly flat internally and slightly
convex externally. Cement coating very thick and extending to within about 5
mm. of the dentine apex, which latter is acute and very slightly curved inward and
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
backward. The root is very unsymmetrical, the posterior portion being much
longer than the anterior. The surface is very rugose, and there is no opening whatever
below. The inferior border is convex, with an emargination near the center.
(<a href="#Plate_39">Pl. 39</a>, figs. 7, 8.)</p>
<p>In the adult skull from Bering Island, which has been mounted and placed on
exhibition, the teeth are fixed in the alveoli so that their entire length and the peculiarities
of the basal portion can not be determined. In general form, however,
they resemble those of the preceding specimen very closely. The anterior teeth
are placed obliquely&mdash;that is, so that the anterior margins of the two teeth are
nearer together than the posterior margins. The teeth are also somewhat inclined
forward. The posterior teeth are strongly inclined forward and a little outward.</p>
<p>The anterior teeth are rather concave along the middle internally and convex
externally. The portion above the alveoli is quite smooth.</p>
<p>The posterior teeth are moderately rugose above the alveoli. The whitish tips
of denture are conical, compressed, and rather acute. They extend 6 mm. above
the denture, and are 11 mm. long at their base, and 6 mm. thick.</p>
<p>The anterior teeth protrude about 45 mm. above the alveolus (internally);
their base at the alveolus is from 73 to 76 mm. long, and from 33 to 35 mm. thick.
The posterior teeth extend about 18 mm. above the alveoli (measured vertically
from the alveolus), and the base of the visible portion (measured along the alveolus)
is from 30 to 34 mm. long and from 18 to 20 mm. thick. These teeth have an antero-external
angular enlargement of the cement, so that they are somewhat triangular
in horizontal section. (<a href="#Plate_30">Pl. 30</a>, fig. 3; <a href="#Plate_31">pl. 31</a>, fig. 5.)</p>
<p>The data available are insufficient to enable one to determine satisfactorily
whether the teeth differ materially in size in the two sexes, but it appears probable
that they do not.</p>
<h4>SKELETON.</h4>
<p>While the skeleton of <i>Berardius bairdii</i> (<a href="#Plate_42">Pl. 42</a>, fig. 4) resembles that of <i>B.
arnuxii</i> very closely in most particulars, it presents differences which may properly
be regarded as specific. The vertebral formula of <i>B. arnuxii</i> as given by Flower is
as follows: C. 7, Th. 10, L. 12, Ca. 19 = 48.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a>
The same formula is given for another
specimen of <i>B. arnuxii</i> by Van Beneden and Gervais, except that the caudals are
17, two being apparently lacking.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a></p>
<p>Doctor Hector, however, gives a different formula for a third specimen of this
species, namely, C. 7, Th. 10, L. 13, Ca. 17 = 47. He remarks that &ldquo;extreme care
was taken to secure the whole of the small tail bones.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a>
The discrepancy here
shown can not be accounted for at present, but, at all events, none of the formulas
of <i>B. arnuxii</i> corresponds to that of <i>B. bairdii</i>, as derived from the three skeletons
in the National Museum, namely, C. 7, Th. 11, L. 12, Ca. 16+ = 46+.</p>
<p>The number of thoracic vertebr&aelig; can be determined positively from the youngish
male from St. George Island (Cat. No. 49727), in which ten pairs of ribs are present,
together with one rib belonging to the eleventh pair. This last is much shorter
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
than the tenth pair, and there can be no doubt that it really belongs to a terminal
pair. In this skeleton the transverse processes of the eleventh thoracic vertebra
are thick at the free end like those of the tenth thoracic vertebra.</p>
<p>In the adult male from Centerville beach, California, only ten pairs of ribs are
present, but as the tenth is quite as long as the ninth, there is little doubt that an
eleventh pair was present originally. The eleventh thoracic vertebra, however,
has transverse processes longer and more flattened at the free end than those of the
tenth thoracic. It is possible, of course, that the real eleventh thoracic is lacking,
and that this individual had thirteen lumbar vertebr&aelig;, but of this there is no positive
evidence.</p>
<p>Only a few of the ribs accompany the skeleton of the adult female from St. George
Island, Alaska (Cat. No. 49726), but there are eleven thoracic vertebr&aelig;, the transverse
processes of the eleventh being short and thick, like those of the tenth, with a
distinct facet for the rib at the free end. This facet, however, is directed obliquely
backward and occupies only the posterior half of the free margin.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the number of thoracic vertebr&aelig; in <i>B.
bairdii</i> is normally 11 and in <i>B. arnuxii</i>, 10. This would ordinarily be of little importance,
as in nearly all kinds of cetaceans a variation of one, or even two, in the
number of thoracic and lumbar vertebr&aelig; in different individuals of the same species
is commonly met with. In the present family, however, the number of thoracic
vertebr&aelig; shows little variation, and as all known skeletons of <i>B. bairdii</i> have eleven
thoracics and all known skeletons of <i>arnuxii</i> appear to have ten thoracics, it seems
probable that this difference is specific. At all events, it is correlated with a difference
in the form of the vertebr&aelig; themselves. As is well known, the transverse
processes of the thoracics in this family undergo a sudden change of form and position
near the end of the series, the elevated processes on the anterior thoracics
being replaced on the posterior vertebr&aelig; by others at a lower level on the sides of
the centra. This change takes place differently and on different vertebr&aelig; in the
two species under consideration.</p>
<h4>VERTEBR&AElig;.</h4>
<p>In <i>B. arnuxii</i> the eighth thoracic has no facet at the posterior end of the centrum
for the articulation of the head of a ninth rib and no distinct transverse process,
the tubercle of the rib articulating with a facet on the side of the metapophysis.
In <i>B. bairdii</i> the eighth thoracic is similar, but there is a distinct facet at the posterior
end of the centrum. (<a href="#Plate_32">Pl. 32</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<p>In <i>B. arnuxii</i> the ninth thoracic has a very distinct transverse process on the
side of the centrum, while in <i>B. bairdii</i> the ninth thoracic has a short, slender process
attached to the side of the metapophysis and no facet at the posterior end of the
centrum. (<a href="#Plate_32">Pl. 32</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<p>In <i>B. arnuxii</i> the tenth thoracic is the second one having a distinct transverse
process, and the latter is broad distally and has the articular facet on the posterior
portion of the free margin. In <i>B. bairdii</i> the tenth thoracic is the first having a distinct
transverse process on the side of the centrum. (<a href="#Plate_32">Pl. 32</a>, fig. 1.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>There are only ten thoracics in <i>B. arnuxii</i>, as already mentioned, but in <i>B.
bairdii</i> there are eleven, and the eleventh is that which bears the second transverse
process on the side of the centrum.</p>
<p>The foregoing differences amount to this: That in <i>B. bairdii</i> the commencement
of the lower series of transverse processes is pushed back one vertebra, as compared
with <i>B. arnuxii</i>, and that in the ninth thoracic of the former species, which
corresponds to the eighth of the latter species, the metapophysis has a short process
on the side for the articulation of the tubercle of the rib, instead of merely a sessile
facet. Although in other genera of ziphioids these differences would perhaps be
looked upon as individual, since they are constant here they may be considered
specific, at least provisionally.</p>
<h4>SCAPULA.</h4>
<p>In <i>B. bairdii</i> the anterior border of the scapula is narrower than in <i>B. arnuxii</i>,
the anterior ridge coming close to it and lying parallel with it. The acromion is
directed more upward, so that the angle between it and the body of the scapula is
more acute, and the process itself is rather more expanded distally. The coronoid
is inclined a little more downward. The whole surface of the scapula is very
uneven. (<a href="#Plate_33">Pl. 33</a>, fig. 2.)</p>
<h4>HUMERUS AND ULNA.</h4>
<p>The humerus is shorter than in <i>B. arnuxii</i> and broader distally, and much more
recurved on the ulnar side. The ulna is much broader distally and its whole shape
is different. (<a href="#Plate_33">Pl. 33</a>, figs. 3 and 4.)</p>
<h4>CHEVRONS.</h4>
<p>As the skeleton of the typical form <i>arnuxii</i> has been described in considerable
detail and accurately figured by Flower and by Van Beneden and Gervais, it is
not considered necessary to give a complete description of that of <i>bairdii</i> in this
place. The entire skeleton and many of the separate bones are figured in Pls.
<a href="#Plate_42">42</a>, <a href="#Plate_32">32</a>, and <a href="#Plate_33">33</a>. The phalanges are lacking altogether, or are incompletely represented,
in the various skeletons of <i>bairdii</i>, and for that reason the phalangeal formula
can not be given. The chevrons number ten in the skeleton from Centerville
beach, California (Cat. No. 49725). Both Flower and Van Beneden and
Gervais give nine chevrons as the number for the skeleton of <i>arnuxii</i> in the Hunterian
Museum, London, but the latter authors have added a tenth in outline in
the figure of the skeleton of that species which is in the Paris Museum. Ten are
mentioned by Hector as the correct number for the skeleton of <i>arnuxii</i> from Wellington
Harbor examined by him.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a></p>
<h4>STERNUM.</h4>
<p>The sternum of <i>bairdii</i> (<a href="#Plate_32">Pl. 32</a>, fig. 2) consists of five segments and does not
offer characters by which to distinguish it from that of <i>arnuxii</i>. In the former
species the first eight pairs of ribs possess distinct heads and tubercles; the tubercle
is rudimentary in the ninth pair and absent in the tenth and eleventh.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the three skeletons of <i>bairdii</i> and of that of <i>arnuxii</i> described
by Flower are as follows:</p>

<p>The National Museum has one skeleton of this well-known species, somewhat
imperfect, which is labeled as having been obtained on the coast of Norway, and was
received about the year 1875. Its catalogue number is 14499. This skeleton is
about 19 feet long and has the following vertebral formula: C. 7; Th. 9; L. 9; Ca.
19 (+1?) = 44 (or 45). Eight chevrons are attached to the caudal vertebr&aelig;, and
at least two more were present originally. The fifth thoracic vertebra has no facet
on the centrum for the head of the sixth rib, but the latter articulates with a small
facet on the side of the centrum of the sixth thoracic vertebra. The seventh
thoracic has a well-developed transverse process on the side of the centrum. The
ninth rib is shorter and more slender than the others. None of the transverse
processes of the caudal vertebr&aelig; are perforated by foramina. These processes end
on the eighth caudal, and the neural spines on the tenth caudal. The free ends of
the neural spines of the thoracic and lumbar vertebr&aelig; are all more or less rounded.
The pectoral limbs are incomplete.</p>
<p>So far as I am aware, only three examples of <i>Hypero&ouml;don</i> have been taken on
the coasts of the United States, as mentioned in the list on <a href="#Page_2">page 2</a>. The skeleton
of one of these (from North Dennis, Massachusetts) is in the Museum of Comparative
Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the skull of the second (from Newport,
Rhode Island), which was a female, is in the Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_38" href="#fr_38">[38]</a>Cope&rsquo;s original description of this species was as follows:
<p class="fncont">&ldquo;Hyperodon semijunctus, sp. nov. The question whether a Hyperodon visits this side of the Atlantic,
has at length been solved by the description which I have received through Dr. Alexander Wilcocks
of this city, of a species taken in Charleston Harbor. This is well drawn up by Gabriel Manigault,
who set up the specimen, which adorns the Charleston Museum. The points wherein it evidently
differs from its congeners, the <i>H. bidens</i> and <i>latifrons</i>, are, first, the separation of the four posterior cervical
vertebr&aelig;, the three anterior only being solidly anchylosed, instead of the seven, as in the known
species, even in the young, according to Dr. J. E. Gray. Second, the possession of one or more pairs
of ribs added to the flying series, and of two more vertebr&aelig;, including ten dorsal instead of nine.
(Nine are given by Cuvier, Ossemens Fossiles, viii, 188; and Flower, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1864, 419,
for the <i>bidens</i>.) Five ribs are connected with the sternum, of which the anterior articulates with the
seventh cervical by its inferior head.</p>
<p class="fncont">&ldquo;I extract the following from Gabr. Manigault&rsquo;s description:</p>
<p class="fncont">&ldquo;&lsquo;The superior maxillary bones are quite pointed in front and widen out toward the base of the
snout. Their lateral edges become developed on each side into a prominent vertical ridge, which is
slightly convex on the outer surface, and the reverse on the inner. These bones, after having widened
out upon approaching the orbits, ascend vertically along with the occipital (the two together holding
the frontal, which is quite perceptible, between them) and form at the back of the head a transverse
ridge, which is quite high and very thick. From my not knowing by what name it was known, I did
not satisfy myself concerning the presence of palatine tubercles. Another peculiarity of the head consists
in the lower maxillary bones being provided each at its point with a single small and very sharp
tooth. These were not noticed during the dissection, owing to their being too much imbedded in the
integuments; they are now, however, quite visible. In the cavity of the skull is a septum of bone
separating the cerebrum from the cerebellum (<i>i. e.</i>, the tentorium). The first rib is very wide and
short, and presents a marked contrast to the others. The sternum is quite flat and wide. The pectoral
fins are small, and have been carefully preserved, with the various carpal and phalangeal bones kept
together by their natural ligaments. As the skeleton stands, the fins consist only of the scapula, the
humerus, the radius, and the ulna, with but few phalanges.</p>
<p class="fncont">&ldquo;&lsquo;The length of this specimen is between twelve and thirteen feet.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<i>Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.</i>,
1865, p. 15.)</p>
